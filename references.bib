  abstract = {Desalination has become one of the obvious solutions for the global water crisis due to affording high-quality water from seawater and brackish water resources. As a result, there are continuing efforts being made to improve desalination technologies, especially the one producing high-quantity freshwater, i.e., thermal desalination. This improvement must be accomplished via enhancement of process design through optimization which is implicitly dependent on providing a generic process model. Due to the scarcity of a comprehensive review paper for modeling multi-effect distillation (MED) process, this topic is becoming more important. Therefore, this paper intends to capture the evolution of modeling the forward feed MED (most common type) and shed a light on its branches of steady-state and dynamic modeling. The maturity of the models developed for MED will be thoroughly reviewed to clarify the general efforts made highlighting the advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the outputs of this review, the requirements of process development and emerging challengeable matters of modeling will be specified. This, in turn, would afford a possible improvement strategy to gain a reliable and sustainable thermal desalination process.},

  abstract = {Scale formation in seawater distillers is mainly caused by crystallization of the inversely soluble salts calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium sulphate. The formation of the alkaline scales CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 strongly depends on temperature, pH, the release rate of CO2 as well as the concentrations of HCO3−, CO32−, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions. The release of CO2 from the evaporating brine shifts the pH to higher values and considerably influences the concentrations of HCO3− and CO32− ions in the brine. Thus, it plays an important role in alkaline scale formation. Based on simulation results for the CO2 release and the carbonate system in a reference multiple-effect distiller, the scale forming potential was inferred from the composition of the brine by using the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and the Ryznar Stability Index (RSI). In the first stage of the reference distiller at a top brine temperature of 64 °C, the LSI based on the solubility product of aragonite increases from 1 on the first tube row to 1.5 on the last tube row. The RSI decreases from 5.9 on the first tube row to 5.0 on the last tube row. Thus it appears that the supersaturation with CaCO3 and the scale forming potential grow along the flow path of brine from the first to the last tube row. The LSI for the brine decreases from 1.5 at the outlet of the first stage to 1.3 at the outlet of the last stage. The RSI increases from 5.0 at the outlet of the first stage to 5.4 at the outlet of the last stage. Since the scaling tendency increases the more the Ryznar Stability Index falls below 6, scale formation is much more likely to occur in the high temperature stages. A larger quantity of scale is to be expected in the first stages on the lower tube rows.},

Included is the flow path of seawater through the final condenser and the evaporator stages. The desorption of CO2 was described as a problem of coupled mass transfer with chemical reaction.A computer program was written for simulating the CO2 release and the carbonate system. The CO2 release rates as well as the HCO3−, CO32−, CO2, H+ and OH− concentrations in the brine were simulated for a multiple-effect distiller with typical dimensions at various operating conditions. The effects of top brine temperature, concentration factor, seawater salinity and pH on CO2 release and the carbonate system were studied. The release rates of CO2 decrease from the first to the last stage. CO2 release increases with increasing top brine temperature. The total CO2 release (sum of the CO2 release in the stages) increases from about 14 g CO2 per ton of feed water at a top brine temperature of 60°C to about 18.2 g/t at 70°C. Between 14\% and 18\% of the total inorganic carbon content in the feed water is released as CO2. CO2 release rates increase with decreasing concentration factor. Relating the desorption rates to the feed water flow rates, the specific CO2 release increases with the concentration factor. CO2 release rises with increasing salinity and decreasing pH of the seawater.},

  abstract = {The integration of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) with reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants presents a promising solution for sustainable water production, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and possessing a high renewable energy potential. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of HRES optimized for 14 RO desalination plants across Saudi Arabia, addressing the critical need for techno-economic optimization in this context. The optimized systems demonstrate consistent renewable energy fractions ranging from 31~\% to 36~\% across various locations, with Duba achieving the highest value at 35.99~\%. Total installed capacities vary widely from 3.022~MW in Farassan to 287.94~MW in Khobar, reflecting diverse local conditions and energy demands resulting from a wide interval of water capacity productions. Despite this variation, the Cost of Energy (COE) remains competitive across all projects, ranging from \$0.0700/kWh to \$0.0783/kWh. A detailed case study of Ras Al Khair, the only site incorporating wind turbines, reveals a 31.82~\% renewable fraction with 47.7~MW PV and 45.5~MW wind capacity. Sensitivity analyses at this site indicate that increasing the renewable fraction from 0~\% to 60~\% raises the Net Present Cost (NPC) from \$509~M to \$685~M at 2 kWh/m3 process energy intensity, with a dramatic spike to \$2320~M at 80~\% renewable fraction. While significant grid interaction persists, with annual purchases ranging from 311 GWh to 829 GWh, the study demonstrates that increasing renewable fractions can lead to long-term cost savings. These findings provide valuable insights for decision-makers and establish guidelines for implementing next-generation RO power plants in KSA, offering a framework applicable to countries facing similar challenges in water scarcity and energy transition.},

  abstract = {Nowcasting and forecasting solar irradiance are vital for the optimal prediction of grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants. These plants face operational challenges and scheduling dispatch difficulties due to the fluctuating nature of their power output. As the generation capacity within the electric grid increases, accurately predicting this output becomes increasingly essential, especially given the random and non-linear characteristics of solar irradiance under variable weather conditions. This study presents a novel prediction method for solar irradiance, which is directly in correlation with PV power output, targeting both short-term and medium-term forecast horizons. Our proposed hybrid framework employs a fast trainable statistical learning technique based on the truncated-regularized kernel ridge regression model. The proposed method excels in forecasting solar irradiance, especially during highly intermittent weather periods. A key strength of our model is the incorporation of multiple historical weather parameters as inputs to generate accurate predictions of future solar irradiance values in its scalable framework. We evaluated the performance of our model using data sets from both cloudy and sunny days in Seattle and Medford, USA and compared it against three forecasting models: persistence, modified 24-hour persistence and least squares. Based on three widely accepted statistical performance metrics (root mean squared error, mean absolute error and coefficient of determination), our hybrid model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy in varying weather conditions and forecast horizons.},

  abstract = {Concentrating solar cogeneration power plants (CSCPP) may provide a key solution for the pressing freshwater deficits in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and could be used in the future for export electricity to Europe. From this standpoint the current study was undertaken to include proposed schemes of CSCPP, that would fully exploit the potential of hybrid reverse osmosis (RO)/multi effect distillation (MED) seawater desalination. Thereby, the primary objective of the present study was to identify and investigate the effectiveness and thermodynamic performance of CSCPP schemes. To satisfy this objective, detailed computational model for key components in the plant has been developed and implemented on simulation computer code. The thermal effectiveness in the computational model was characterized by the condition of attaining a maximum fuel saving in the electrical power grid (EPG). The study result shows the effectiveness of proposed CSCPP schemes. Especially the integrated gas turbine solar cogeneration power plant (IGSCP) scheme seems to be an alternative of the most effective technologies in terms of technical, economic and environmental sustainability. For the case study (IGSCP and the design number of effects 10 for low-temperature MED unit) the economical effect amount 172.3 ton fuel/year for each MW design thermal energy of parabolic solar collector array (PSCA). The corresponding decrease in exhaust gases emission (nitrogen oxides (NOx) 0.681 ton/year MW, carbon dioxides (CO2) 539.5 ton/year MW). Moreover, the increase in the output of PSCA and, subsequently, in solar power generation, will also be useful to offset the normal reduction in performance experienced by gas turbine unit during the summer season. Hence, the influence of the most important design parameters on the effectiveness of ISGPP has been discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The primary energy consumption of a spectrum of desalination systems is assessed using operating information and technical bids for real plants configured with coproduction of electricity. The energy efficiency of desalination plants is often rated on a stand-alone basis using metrics such as specific energy consumption, gained output ratio, and second law efficiency, which can lead to inconsistent conclusions because the heat and electrical work inputs to the plant have very different exergies and costs, which must be taken into account. When both the heat and work inputs are drawn from a common primary energy source, such as the fuel provided to electricity-water coproduction systems, these inputs can be compared and combined if they are traced back to primary energy use. In the present study, we compare 48 different configurations of electricity production and desalination on the basis of primary energy use, including cases with pretreatment and hybridized systems, using performance figures from real and quoted desalination systems operating in the GCC region. The results show that, while reverse osmosis is still the most energy efficient desalination technology, the gap between work and thermally driven desalination technologies is reduced when considered on the basis of primary energy. The results also show that pretreatment with nanofiltration or hybridization of multiple desalination systems can help to reduce energy requirements. Additionally, the specific type of power plant in the coproduction scheme and its operating parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of desalination technologies relative to one other.},

The change from one operation mode to another, where each operation mode is defined by a discrete variable set, implies a change in the process behaviour that must be counteracted by the control system. In this work, a practical hybrid model predictive control is proposed to take the behaviour changes related to the hybrid nature of the process into account. The proposed control algorithm is based on the adaptation of several well-known control strategies that have been successfully applied in the industrial field. A solar thermal system (composed of a solar thermal flat collector field, one or more accumulation tanks connected in series and a gas heater) is used to show the resulting control strategy through detailed simulations.

  abstract = {Thermal energy loss in the process industry is a significant issue due to the high temperatures and multiple heat intensive processes involved. High-grade thermal energy is typically recovered within processes. However, lower grade heat is often rejected to the environment. The benefits of capturing and utilising low grade thermal energy are highly dependent on the qualities and properties of the heat in the waste streams. The temperature of the low grade heat stream is the most important parameter, as the effective use of the residual heat or the efficiency of energy recovery from the low grade heat sources will mainly depend on the temperature difference between the source and a suitable sink, e.g. another process or space heating/cooling. In general, the temperatures of these waste heat sources are too low to produce electricity and direct heat use will depend on whether potential user can be found. This paper presents past and current drivers for heat recovery studies. High and low grade heat sources are defined according to the viability of recovery within the processes. Firstly, high grade heat capture within the processes is reviewed. Then, the focus is on the potential for low grade heat capture outside of the original plant. The paper addresses the potential for low grade heat recovery with regard to new incentives and technological advances. Finally, different aspects which influence the decision making for low grade heat recovery in the process industry are discussed. It is concluded that organisational, financial and economic barriers might be overcome and benefits from a holistic vision could be gained with stronger governmental policy and regulation incentives.},

  abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose known physical laws into the learning of deep neural networks, making sure they respect the physics of the process while decreasing the demand of labeled data. For systems represented by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), the conventional PINN has a continuous time input variable and outputs the solution of the corresponding ODE. In their original form, PINNs do not allow control inputs, neither can they simulate for variable long-range intervals without serious degradation in their predictions. In this context, this work presents a new framework called Physics-Informed Neural Nets for Control (PINC), which proposes a novel PINN-based architecture that is amenable to control problems and able to simulate for longer-range time horizons that are not fixed beforehand, making it a very flexible framework when compared to traditional PINNs. Furthermore, this long-range time simulation of differential equations is faster than numerical methods since it relies only on signal propagation through the network, making it less computationally costly and, thus, a better alternative for simulation of models in Model Predictive Control. We showcase our proposal in the control of two nonlinear dynamic systems: the Van der Pol oscillator and the four-tank system.},

Detailed comparative assessment of three cooling technologies, i.e., wet, dry, and hybrid, is therefore desirable so as to facilitate selection of optimum cooling technology for the plant. Despite the high efficiency of wet cooling technology, considering the fact that the potential plant locations are generally in arid regions suffering from water scarcity, it is imperative to explore and consider other water conserving condenser cooling options. A review and comparison of technical, economic, and environmental aspects of the three condenser cooling technologies for CSP plants have been presented. Adoption of dry or hybrid technology as against wet cooling technology may lead to reduced thermal performance and increased parasitic power requirement resulting in the high cost of electricity generation. However, the same also results in reduced cooling water requirement up to 92\% and thus increase the potential of solar thermal power generation considerably as sites in arid areas can also be utilized.},

  abstract = {Adsorption desalination is prescribed as a promising and eco-friendly solution for mitigating water scarcity, owing to its utilization of low-grade thermal waste and zero liquid brine discharge. The keystones that regulate the performance of the adsorption desalination system (ADS) include nature of adsorbents, system design, and operating conditions. The present study aims to provide a state of the art review on the keystones of ADS. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold remarkable adsorption capacity and tunable structure. However, hydrothermal instability, high cost, and complex synthesizing procedures are the potential challenges that need to be addressed. The technological advancements in ADS have been classified into: (i) Conventional Approach, (ii) Heat and Mass Recovery Approaches, (iii) Hybridization Approaches, (iv) and Adsorbent Substituting Approach. The study provides critical insight and compares the performance of each approach based on specific daily water production (SDWP), specific cooling power (SCP), and coefficient of performance (COP). The conventional ADS produce SDWP of 4.7~m3/ton/d, however producing zero and/or minimal SCP while using payable energy of 1.50~kWh/m3. In heat/mass recovery approaches, pressure equalization-valve delay schemes and master–slave configuration provide~∼~5~\% additional water adsorption/desorption on/from silica-gel and reduce~∼~50~\% thermal heating load, respectively. Evaporator-condenser amalgamation emphasizes the evaporator temperature of 30–42~°C leading towards~∼~69~\% higher SDWP with zero SCP. Dual stage, multi evaporators/condensers scheme is found supportive in cogenerating feature of ADS thereby improvising COP to~∼~0.87. In hybridization approach, ejector integrated ADS produces SDWP of 80~m3/ton and COP of 2.22 using payable energy of 0.92~kWh/m3, however, needs experimental validation. In the adsorbent substituting approach, CPO-27(Ni), Emim-Ac/Syloid 72FP, and composite adsorbent manifest the SDWP to higher levels. The operating conditions are sensitive and need to optimize depending on the configuration of ADS. Possible future research directions may include efficient designing/ sizing of evaporators/ condensers, minimizing the heat and mass transfer resistances in adsorber/desorber reactor, optimize the thickness of the adsorbent layer in heat exchangers, and investigating wide range of adsorbent classes that can be driven with very low regeneration temperature.},

Dry-cooling systems allow a water consumption reduction of up to 80\% but at the expense of lower electricity production. A hybrid cooling system (the combination of dry and wet cooling) offers the advantages of each process in terms of lower water consumption and higher electricity production. A model of a CSP plant which integrates a hybrid cooling system has been implemented in Thermoflex software. The water consumption and the net power generation have been evaluated for different configurations of the hybrid cooling system: series, parallel, series-parallel and parallel-series. It was found that the most favourable configuration in terms of water saving was series-parallel, in which a water reduction of up to 50\% is possible compared to the only-wet cooling option, whereas an increase of 2.5\% in the power generation is possible compared to the only-dry cooling option. The parallel configuration was the best in terms of power generation with an increase of 3.2\% when compared with the only-dry cooling option, and a reduction of 30\% water consumption compared to the only-wet cooling option.},

  abstract = {[Resumen] El Comité Español de Automática (CEA) es una asociación científica sin ánimo de lucro que impulsa el desarrollo, la investigación y las enseñanzasuniversitarias en Automática. Es miembro nacional de la Federación Internacional de Control Automático (IFAC), y celebra anualmente desde el año 1977 las Jornadas de Automática. Estas se organizan por distintas universidades o centros de investigación de habla hispana. El objetivo de las mismas es reunir a profesores, investigadores, estudiantes y profesionales del ámbito de la Automática para tratar temas vinculados con la docencia y la investigación (automatización y control, instrumentación, robótica, modelado y simulación de sistemas, visión por computador, ingeniería biomédica, inteligencia artificial, educación).  Las XLIV Jornadas de Automática se celebran de manera totalmente presencial en Zaragoza los días 6, 7 y 8 de septiembre de 2023. Hoy es ya la cuarta ciudad de España, con unos 700.000 habitantes, una gran actividad y oferta de turismo de ocio, de negocios, de congresos y reuniones, cultural y  gastronómica. Tiene una historia que se aprecia en el contraste entre sus rincones históricos y su arquitectura moderna. La ubicación de Zaragoza es estratégicamente inmejorable y se encuentra perfectamente comunicada con las principales ciudades de España. Se trata de una ciudad altamente dinámica en muchos aspectos y en particular en la creación de empresas.  La Universidad de Zaragoza tiene su origen en un estudio de artes, creado por la Iglesia en el siglo XII, donde se enseñaban gramática y filosofía, y que concedía títulos de bachiller. En noviembre de 1582, Pedro Cerbuna, prior de la catedral de San Salvador de Zaragoza y más tarde obispo de  Tarazona, aportó los medios económicos necesarios para abrir la nueva universidad, que se inauguró el 24 de mayo de 1583.  Las XLIV Jornadas de Automática tienen su sede en la Escuela de Ingeniería y Arquitectura (EINA) de la Universidad de Zaragoza, la universidad pública de Aragón. En la EINA se imparten diferentes grados y másteres relacionados con los ámbitos de la ingeniería y la arquitectura, y participa en diversos  programas de doctorado. La presente edición está organizada por profesores e investigadores pertenecientes principalmente al Área de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Automática y al Instituto de Investigación en Ingeniería de Aragón. Cuenta con la participación de más de 250 asistentes.  El programa de esta edición desarrolla, como en ediciones anteriores, una variedad de actividades científico-técnicas, sociales y culturales. En eprograma científico-técnico, las sesiones de los 9 Grupos Temáticos de CEA están dedicadas a la discusión de las actividades de cada uno de ellos desarrolladas y a desarrollar en el futuro. Además, en esta edición en cadaGrupo Temático se exponen oralmente comunicaciones seleccionadas entre los 154 trabajos aceptados para su publicación en las Actas y su exposición como pósteres durante todo el desarrollo de las Jornadas. Hay dos sesiones plenarias a cargo de dos investigadoras muy relevantes en el panorama internacional, una mesa redonda sobre  financiación de la investigación, una sesión Industria 4.0 en la que se presentarán casos de éxito de colaboración empresa-universidad, y una sesión especial en colaboración con la sección española de la  International Society of Automation (ISA). Asimismo, en los stands se desarrollan demostraciones de aplicaciones con robots y sistemas automáticos. En el evento se entregan premios a los mejores trabajos y tesis doctorales en el marco de trabajo de los Grupos Temáticos, el “Premio Nacional de Automática” (edición 2023) y el “Premio CEA al Joven Talento Femenino en Automática”. En esta edición se realiza un homenaje especial al fallecido Profesor Dr. Manuel Silva Suarez, persona de extraordinaria relevancia científica nacional e internacional y querido amigo.  También se realizan actividades culturales para dar a conocer mejor la ciudad, en su aspecto histórico, con visitas guiadas a los “2000 años de historias” y al Palacio de la Aljafería, y en su aspecto actual, con una visita guiada al Museo de la Movilidad en el Pabellón Puente. El Comité Organizador quiere agradecer a los participantes las contribuciones al evento; a las empresas patrocinadores de los premios y actividades, a los comités de dirección, científico, a la Universidad de Zaragoza, y a las autoridades académicas, locales y de la Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón. Queremos transmitir un agradecimiento especial al Servicio de Bibliotecas de la Universidade da Coruña (UDC), por el trabajo desarrollado para la edición de las Actas de las Jornadas.

  abstract = {In search of new sources of water supply, seawater desalination is increasingly recognized as a viable option. In arid coastal areas, the lack of fresh water coincides often with an abundance of solar energy. Coupling desalination systems with renewable energy technologies is of great importance. Project SMADES funded by the EC has sponsored the development of a so-called “large SMADES” system. The system is designed to provide high quality potable water in remote coastal areas with low infrastructure and without connection to a grid. The energy for the desalination process is supplied entirely by solar thermal collectors in the form of heat on a temperature level of 60°C to 80°C. The desalination units are improved membrane distillation (MD) modules with internal heat recovery function. The electrical auxiliary energy which is required to drive the pumps and valves for the automatically operated systems is supplied by PV panels. The collector area is 72 m2, the hydraulic loop of the collector field comprises a solar heat storage tank of 3 m3 and the collector loop is separated from the seawater loop of the MDdesalination-modules. Automatic controls start up the desalination unit whenever sufficient sunlight is present to provide hot water and electricity for pumping from the solar collectors and PV panels. This paper describes this plant that has been assembled at the Marine Science Station (MSS) of Aqaba, Jordan, and presents the results of the first few months of operation. The feed water was seawater directly from the Red Sea.},

In cold months heat is provided to a district heating system. Another peculiarity of this plant is that the condenser system is organized with an air condenser and a water cooled condenser, coupled with a wet cooling tower. This work shows how the net power output can be maximized by properly regulating the combined wet and dry units of the combined cooling system. A detailed model of the steam cycle was performed by means of a commercial code (Thermoflex®). Off design performance were carefully predicted to simulate accurately the real thermal cycle behaviour. Once the power cycle performance has been predicted over an extensive range of operating conditions, an optimal search method was implemented to find the set of variables allowing the wet and dry cooling system to be regulated so that the maximum net power is achieved. In general, the best strategy resulted in loading as much as possible the wet cooling system to reduce the operational cost of the dry air condenser. Conversely, the whole exhaust steam flow rate has to be sent only to the air condenser when the district heating water request is very large, i.e. in coldest months.},

  abstract = {In Brescia, Italy, heat is delivered to 70\% of 200.000 city inhabitants by means of a district heating system, mainly supplied by a waste to energy plant, utilizing the non recyclable fraction of municipal and industrial solid waste (800,000tons/year, otherwise landfilled), thus saving annually over 150,000tons of oil equivalent and over 400,000tons of CO2 emissions. This study shows how the performance of the waste-to-energy cogeneration plant can be improved by optimising the condensation system, with particular focus on the combination of wet and dry cooling systems. The analysis has been carried out using two subsequent steps: in the first one a schematic model of the steam cycle was accomplished in order to acquire a knowledge base about the variables that would be most influential on the performance. In the second step the electric power output for different operating conditions was predicted and optimized in a homemade program. In more details, a thermodynamic analysis of the steam cycle, according to the design operating condition, was performed by means of a commercial code (Thermoflex©) dedicated to power plant modelling. Then the off-design behaviour was investigated by varying not only the ambient conditions but also several parameters connected to the heat rejection rate, like the heat required from district heating and the auxiliaries load. Each of these parameters has been addressed and considered in determining the overall performance of the thermal cycle. After that, a complete prediction of the cycle behaviour was performed by simultaneously varying different operating conditions. Finally, a Matlab© computer code was developed in order to optimize the net electric power as a function of the way in which the condensation is operated. The result is an optimum set of variables allowing the wet and dry cooling system to be regulated in such a way that the maximum power is achieved. The best strategy consists in using the maximum amount of heat rejection in the wet cooling system to reduce the operational cost of the dry one.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the annual performance of multi-effect desalination plant combined with a thermo-compressor MED–TC driven by a solar steam generation plant. The desalination model is coupled with solar steam generation plant model to supply the necessary thermal energy to drive the desalination plant. The developed model determines the fresh water production rate and the specific energy consumption. The desalination plant is located in Aqaba, Jordan which is located in a coastal region that receives high levels of solar radiation. Simulations of the system (desalination plant + steam generation plant) are carried out under different operating and geometrical conditions to investigate the plant performance. The desalination plant is sized to produce 50,000m3/day of fresh water continuously to meet the expected commercial and tourism growth. Results show that with collector area equal to 1,080,000m2 and storage size of 75l per square meter of solar collector, the solar energy is capable of covering up to 68\% of the total thermal energy required using storage capacity by the desalination plant with annual solar field efficiency of about 55\%. The solar field oriented along a north–south axis presents the best performance and the solar fraction does not increase significantly as the pressure of the saturated steam generated varies.},

  abstract = {Long-term stability and long-term performance of thermal storage media are a key issue that should be thoroughly analysed when developing storage systems. However, no testing protocol or guideline exists up to now for validating storage media, so that authors apply their own criteria, not only for designing testing procedures but also for predicting the material behaviour under long-term operation. This paper aims to cover this gap by proposing a methodology for validating thermal storage media; in particular, phase change materials (PCMs). This methodology consists of different stages that include PCM characterization, preliminary assessment tests, and accelerated life testing. For designing the accelerated life tests, lifetime relationship models have to be obtained in order to predict PCM long-term behaviour under service conditions from shorter tests performed under stress conditions. The approach followed in this methodology will be valid for materials to be used as sensible or thermochemical storage media, too.},

  abstract = {Solar-powered desalination comprises all methods that use the sun's energy indirectly by means of solar collectors. All solar-driven desalination processes, except solar distillation, can be fired indirectly by solar energy. In this chapter the combinations of solar thermal desalination devices to solar concentrating collectors are explained. It concerns medium to large desalination and solar plants. Initially the various types of solar collectors of large solar concentrating fields are shortly described so that the reader can have a general view of the solar concentrating plants that transform solar radiation into thermal energy. Some specific definitions and nomenclatures are described, to help the reader understand what the solar concentrators and the desalination distillation plants are. Factors that are of importance and affect the selection of the type of the two plants, for the optimum efficiencies of both systems and for the higher water productivity, are given. These determine the suitability of these combinations. Various types of solar collectors are shortly described. They include all types of solar flat-plate collectors up to point focus and heliostats for central receiver systems. The conventional desalination thermal systems, that is, conventional distillation methods, types and configurations of the corresponding evaporators, such as multiple effects distillation, multistage flash, mechanical vapor compression, and thermal vapor compression, and the variations in construction are presented for large capacity installations. For each conventional distillation method, the mathematical equations, concerning heat transfer conditions and heat balance of the system, are briefly depicted. Diagrams of temperature distribution are also given. For economic reasons, the combination of electricity production by the solar plant with hybrid and/or conventional evaporators is of importance to achieve optimum performances, as high-pressure steam from a solar collector field can be used for electricity production and waste, and low-temperature heat for the desalination plant.},

  abstract = {Humidification/dehumidification (H/D) is in fact a small to medium capacity desalination method driven by solar energy or waste heat. In this chapter, initially a short historical introduction is given on how this method is derived from solar distillation procedure by using separate devices (champers or towers) for evaporation and condensation processes in contrary to solar distillation where the two operations take place in only one chamber. The basic operating principles of the two configurations, such as closed water–open air and closed air–open water of the single H/D, are presented. The majority of all H/D concepts are driven by solar energy and/or by waste heat. As these H/D systems are based on H/D principles in separate chambers, a short description of Mollier (h–x diagrams) and psychrometric charts, used in drying, with chart examples is presented to facilitate calculations of H/D in the corresponding chambers. The main relationships of mass and heat transfer and mathematical models of the single effect or multiple effect configurations for the humidifier (evaporator) and the condenser (dehumidifier) are given. The corresponding temperature–enthalpy diagrams for the two chambers are presented as well as examples for calculations. The dewvaporation procedure having the two chambers in contact, leaving the vapor to be transferred through a separating wall, is included. Multiple effect H/D offers the possibility for air to be loaded by reheating with as much as possible vapor in the humidification chamber. Mathematical models of this H/D concept including Mollier charts of humidity calculations are also presented. Various other concepts of operation that exist, such as the desiccant absorption/desorption H/D process using zeolite or lithium bromide as vapor absorbent, the membrane drying dehumidification using selective membranes, varied H/D cycle, and the thermocompression method, are shortly described. At the end of this chapter, the thermoeconomics of this method is described. Greenhouses are important in dry regions which have intensive solar radiation and no usable water resources. The combination of solar-driven H/D method and solar stills with greenhouses to supply the necessary humidity to the greenhouse plants gives a good solution to produce simultaneously fresh water and crops in dessert lands. A short description of this combination and figures of installations is presented.},

The method of Cao and Rhinehart (J. Process Control 1995, 5 (6), 363−374) was modified for steady-state identification by optimizing the filter constants so as to minimize type I and II errors and simultaneously reduce the delay in state detection. A simple algorithm has been presented that makes use of past measurements and the Kalman filter to detect the presence of gross error and estimate its magnitude. This algorithm simultaneously reconciles data for random measurement errors. Another algorithm that makes use of the exponential filter along with the least-squares minimization strategy is also applied for data reconciliation and found to perform equally well. All of these algorithms have been applied to data from an industrial crude distillation unit. The presence of strong autocorrelation in the industrial data was dealt with by adding random noise. This strategy makes the steady-state identification algorithm more suitable for online application.},

  abstract = {With emphasis on close boiling, (near-)ideal VLE mixtures, this paper links the efficiency of distillation to the binary feed composition and thermal properties of the compounds. The proposed approach, treating the process as a heat engine, allows to directly quantify distillation performance (in terms of energy intensity \& efficiency) based on the components boiling points and feed composition. In addition, this approach reviews and formulates simple, approximate and essentially non-iterative calculation procedures to quickly estimate the energy efficiency of distillation. These estimations may be applied to identify opportunities to save significant amounts of energy. The results show that the reboiler duty for low relative volatility is relatively independent of the heat of vaporization and feed composition, while being reciprocally proportional to the Carnot efficiency of the distillation column. The internal efficiency for distillation of mixtures with low relative volatility has a maximum of about 70\% for a symmetrical feed (equimolar ratio) and decreases to zero for unsymmetrical feed compositions approaching infinite dilution. With increasing relative volatility, the maximum efficiency is preserved, but the locus shifts towards lower light component fractions. At very high relative volatility, the internal efficiency increases with decreasing concentration of light component, as typical for evaporators.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {Energy cost contributes a large portion of the overall cost of desalinated water. Improving the energy efficiency of desalination plants is therefore a primary design goal. However, accurately evaluating and comparing the energy consumption of desalination plants that use different forms and grades of energy is difficult, especially for power–water coproduction systems in which primary energy (PE) consumption leads to both salable electricity and potable water. The power plant converts PE into grades of thermal energy and electricity usable by the desalination plant. To fully capture the thermodynamic and economic cost of energy, and to fairly compare desalination systems that use different grades of input energy, we must compare energy consumption not at the point where energy enters the desalination plant itself, but as PE consumption entering the power plant. This paper investigates a variety of metrics for comparing the energy and exergy consumption attributable to desalination in coproduction plants. Previous results have shown that reverse osmosis (RO) is approximately twice as efficient as multiple effect distillation (MED) on a PE basis. We then compare the PE consumption of MED and RO from a thermoeconomic perspective. The entropy generation at the RO membrane and in the MED effects are derived in similar terms, which enables a comparison of the overall heat transfer coefficient in an MED system to the permeability of an RO membrane. RO outperforms MED in energy efficiency because of a balance of material costs, transport coefficients, and cost of energy.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {This thermodynamic study examines the principles governing energy efficiency and specific energy requirement intrinsic to thermal desalination processes. The practical performances of desalination technologies are investigated and related to the fundamental physical limitations of the processes. The energy efficiency of any thermal desalination process fulfils a limitation similar to the well-known Carnot law for heat engines. The efficiency of a single-effect distiller is limited by a function of the boiling point elevation of the solution. Further analysis shows that, although this can appear as paradoxical, a higher energy efficiency is obtained by a solution with higher boiling point elevation. For multiple-effect distillation, the limit also depends on the temperature drops across the heat exchangers. Comparison with empirical data indicates that these limits are actually approached in real plants. Our study discusses the thermodynamic framework for understanding the performances of thermally-driven desalination technologies, emphasizing the role of the boiling point elevation. The results can be also seen as rules-of-thumb for designing and evaluating the performances of a multiple-effect distillation unit, based only on the properties of the solution to be distilled, in particular, the boiling point elevation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the potential of industrial waste heat for heating and cooling applications is investigated. Therefore, heat transformation technologies are presented and their technical and economic potential are discussed. First, different industrial processes and their operating temperatures are presented as possible waste heat sources as well as low temperature processes, which can be supplied with waste heat. Then, a general economic analysis is performed for three different cases of waste heat use: an absorption chiller producing cold and heat production with a compression and an absorption heat pump. The maximum acceptable investment cost for each technology is estimated and compared with the current investment cost depending on the operating hours of the system. For this, three different consumer types, Enthusiast, Real Estate and Industry, are defined to represent different expectations in interest rate, payback period and the resulting annuity factor. Instead of judging if a technology is profitable or not, it is calculated how much the system is allowed to cost in order to be competitive for certain operating hours. Combined with present day cost of the technology, this serves as a rough judgment of the market deployment process. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the initial assumptions for the economic analysis is performed, revealing a strong influence of the annuity factor. For the present day technology cost, absorption chillers were found to be profitable for two of the three consumer types when operated for at least 2500h per year. Electric heat pumps are profitable for all consumer types when exceeding 4000operating hours per year while absorption heat pumps start at 3000h of operation per year to be profitable for all consumer types.},

  abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

An equation-based object-oriented mathematical model of the experimental MED plant, implemented using the modeling language Modelica and previously developed, calibrated and validated, has been adapted to carry out this study. Firstly, an energetic and exergetic analysis of the process under nominal conditions has been carried out, revealing the key sources of energy and exergy consumption. On the one hand, the thermal energy contained in the mass outflows are the main responsible source of the high energy consumption, on the other hand the entropy generation and the heat exchanged with the environment are the responsible of the exergy degradation. Secondly, a study on the influence of the operational parameters shows that the production of the real plant under nominal conditions is far from the maximum simulated values and some operational parameters have not a great influence in the process with respect to the rest. Finally, using a genetic optimization algorithm implemented in the modeling tool, a optimization process taking into account different energy and exergy performance criteria, sets optimal operational set points.},

  abstract = {Multiple effect distillation (MED) is nowadays the preferred technology for the construction of new plants based on thermal processes in the growing desalination market. MED technology, in fact, presents a number of advantages with respect to the more traditional multistage flash technology, among all the lower energy consumption achievable in MED plants. However, a large potential for improvement in terms of lowering production costs still exists, which stimulates further efforts on process optimization from companies and researchers involved in the field. Thermodynamic and exergy analysis provides useful insights regarding the identification of main inefficiencies and the margins for performance improvements. A number of works have focused their attention on these aspects, presenting innovative investigation tools eventually applied to theoretical or real case studies. In the present chapter, the fundamentals of thermodynamic and exergy analysis for MED process optimization are presented. “Exergy costing” is also discussed and proposed as an innovative method capable of reflecting how thermal inefficiencies contribute to a gradual increase in the economic value (to be intended as a cost of generation) of material streams along the process. In order to achieve a more comprehensive view, the aforementioned analyses are carried out for a reference MED plant assumed as the case study.},

Cones of directions of decrease, cones of feasible directions and a cone of tangent directions, as well as, a new cone of directions of nonincrease play an important role here. The dual cones to the cones of direction of decrease and to the cones of directions of nonincrease are characterized for convex functionals without differentiability, with the aid of their subdifferential, making the optimality theorems applicable. The theory is applied to vector mathematical programming, giving a generalized Fritz John theorem, and other applications are mentioned. It turns out that, under suitable convexity and regularity assumptions, the necessary conditions for local Pareto optima are also necessary and sufficient for global Pareto optimum. With the aid of the theory presented here, a result is obtained for the, so-called, “scalarization” problem of multiobjective optimization.},

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

One sustainable method for brine treatment is to develop zero liquid discharge systems that completely convert seawater into freshwater and salts. This paper presents a zero liquid discharge system, which consists of multi-effect distillation and evaporative crystallization, to treat desalination brine with a salinity of 70 g/kg. A thermodynamic analysis is firstly conducted for the proposed system. The specific heat consumption, specific heat transfer area, and Second-law efficiency are found to be 600–1100 kJ/kg, 110–340 m2/(kg/s), and 10–17\%, respectively. The heat consumption can be effectively reduced by increasing the number of MED stages, while the specific heat transfer area decreases significantly with higher heat source temperatures. Based on the thermodynamic performance, a techno-economic analysis is conducted for the proposed system, and the specific cost is calculated to be \$4.17/m3. Cost reduction can be achieved via employing cost-effective heat sources, reducing heat consumption, and scaling up the system. By selling the freshwater and salt crystals, the system will be more competitive than other existing brine treatment methods.},

To deal with the nature of variable appearance of clouds, we use clusters of feature points to perform tracking. We propose an enhanced clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of number of clusters. The proposed clustering algorithm can successfully separate feature points into groups with reasonable sizes and ranges. In the tracking process, merging and splitting of clouds are handled via checking matched pairs of feature points among different clusters. Afterwards, the tracking information is utilized to predict if the sun will be covered or obscured by clouds within the prediction horizon. Features are extracted from the tracked feature points and a Markov chain model is designed to perform ramp-down event prediction. The obscuration and ramp-down events have an important impact on solar irradiance. The experiments have shown that the proposed system can substantially enhance the accuracy of solar irradiance nowcasting on a challenging dataset.},

  abstract = {The stochastic cloud cover on photovoltaic (PV) panels affects the solar power outputs, producing high instability in the integrated power systems. It is an effective approach to track the cloud motion during short-term PV power forecasting based on data sources of satellite images. However, since temporal variations of these images are noisy and non-stationary, pixel-sensitive prediction methods are critically needed in order to seek a balance between the forecast precision and the huge computation burden due to a large image size. Hence, a graphical learning framework is proposed in this study for intra-hour PV power prediction. By simulating the cloud motion using bi-directional extrapolation, a directed graph is generated representing the pixel values from multiple frames of historical images. The nodes and edges in the graph denote the shapes and motion directions of the regions of interest (ROIs) in satellite images. A spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) is then proposed to deal with the graph. Comparing with conventional deep-learning-based models, GNN is more flexible for varying sizes of input, in order to be able to handle dynamic ROIs. Referring to the comparative studies, the proposed method greatly reduces the redundancy of image inputs without sacrificing the visual scope, and slightly improves the prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades, developments in desalination plants have been focused on the minimization of its energetic consumption and cost. Advancements include emerging technologies that make use of low grade thermal energy, like Multi-Effect Distillation (MED). The energy optimization of MED systems and their coupling with solar thermal technologies have been deeply investigated by the Solar Desalination Unit of the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) through a solar desalination test facility consisting of a MED plant coupled to a static solar field. Recently, the previous solar field composed of compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) has been replaced by a new one with large-aperture flat plate collectors (FPC). In this work, an experimental characterization of the solar MED system under off-design conditions is presented and discussed. The efficiency of the FPCs’ solar field at several temperature levels for different climate conditions has been determined. Also, the influence of the variation of key parameters by which the MED plant is controlled (the inlet hot water flow rate (mhot) and temperature (Thot), the feed water flow rate (mf) and the condenser vapor temperature (Tc)) on the freshwater production and performance ratio (PR), were analyzed with an experimental campaign of 82experiments. The results obtained were used to fit polynomial expressions, validated statistically, that predict the distillate yield and the PR for different operation strategies. The experimental characterization of the desalination plant revealed that the rise in the Tc has the highest impact in the thermal efficiency of the MED unit, and the rise in the mf has the greatest influence on the distillation production. Moreover, from the analysis of the coupling of the MED plant with the solar field it was found that the thermal storage has an autonomy of up to 6h when the MED works with hot water at 65°C, which allows the plant to continue the operation even in transient periods (presence of clouds). Also, from a theoretical annual study for the solar MED system, it was found that the annual solar fraction ranges from 30.7\% to 42.4\%, which leads to an annual distillate production between 6701m3 and 11,314m3, respectively.},

  abstract = {The Boosted MED technology is a thermal desalination process dedicated to low-grade waste heat sources. By augmenting the standard Multi Effect Distillation (MED) process with an additional Booster Module, the system is capable of further exploiting the heating medium output stream of the basic MED system and boosting the freshwater production of the system in an effective manner. This paper experimentally evaluates the principal design basis of the Boosted MED technology. A state-of-the-art pilot plant consisting of two evaporator modules in a serial connection is used to assess the additional vapour production from the downstream evaporator, which adequately mimics the booster unit, at heat source temperatures of 68°C to 93°C, cooling water temperatures of 20°C to 35°C, and two feedwater salinities. Additional vapour production rates ranging from 33\% to 57\% at sufficiently high temperatures demonstrate the general viability of the design hypothesis. The stable operation and the very high distillate quality achieved by the pilot plant augur well a favourable system characteristic. The process simulation model developed for designing and optimising Multi Effect Distillation based technologies has been experimentally demonstrated to be consistent with the pilot plant performance.},

Conventional Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) technologies, constrained by their inherent design, fail to unleash its full potential by a far measure. We identified major drivers critical to the coupling of such heat source with MED technologies, and critically compared our recently introduced Boosted MED scheme against a variation of the commonly practiced feed pre-heating MED scheme, both of which are scalable system modifications that are better suited for the coupling. For most operational conditions germane to sensible waste heat sources and renewable energies, the Boosted MED system offers both a thermodynamic and economic superior performance, especially when low heating media temperatures prevail. From about 80°C onwards, feed pre-heating becomes thermodynamically increasingly competitive, but due to the rising auxiliary power demand fails to surpass the Boosted MED on an economic comparison over the surveyed application range.},

We demonstrate this with the optimisation of multi effect distillation systems, so that freshwater yield can be improved by up to 40\% for both conventional and advanced systems.

  abstract = {Growing desalination capacity worldwide has made management of discharge brines an increasingly urgent environmental challenge. An important step in understanding how to choose between different brine management processes is to study the energetics of these processes. In this paper, we analyze two different ways of managing highly saline brines. The first method is complete separation with production of salts (i.e., zero-discharge desalination or ZDD). Thermodynamic limits of the ZDD process were calculated. This result was applied to the state-of-the-art industrial ZDD process to quantify how close these systems are to the thermodynamic limit, and to compare the energy consumption of the brine concentration step to the crystallization step. We conclude that the brine concentration step has more potential for improvement compared to the crystallization step. The second brine management method considered is salinity-gradient power generation through pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO), which utilizes the brine's high concentration to produce useful work while reducing its concentration by mixing the brine with a lower salinity stream in a controlled manner. We model the PRO system coupled with a desalination system using a detailed numerical optimization, which resulted in about 0.42kWh/m3 of energy saving.},

Considering the importance of water in guaranteeing environmental sustainability, a review of water consumption parameters is presented, and water consumption in the SPT plants that are in the planning stages for southern Spain are analyzed as examples. The selected region for the present study, is exposed to high horizontal solar irradiance, undergoes large seasonal weather fluctuations (prolonged droughts) and is located far from the coast (determining the site׳s topography and soil availability). These characteristics demonstrate that water consumption is one of the decisive factors for the construction of new solar plants in similar locations worldwide, in addition to other considerations such as capital cost or plant efficiency. Currently, most SPT plants are based on the Rankine cycle via a conventional steam turbine generator, which implies the requirement of a cooling system using water. In this paper, all current cooling technologies are reviewed and the required water consumption is analyzed. The impact of plant consumption on the area of SPT plant location is analyzed as well. This paper also discusses the socio-economics and environmental effects of an implemented cooling system. In addition, this paper presents different technical alternatives for minimizing water consumption for cooling and the effects thereof on the rest of the key parameters in the development and construction of a new SPT plant.},

  abstract = {Desalination is one of the possible solutions to the world’s potable water scarcity. In order to make the process feasible and sustainable, use of renewable energy is a very useful option. The multi-effect desalination (MED) process linked with solar energy is one of the most thermodynamically efficient and the one with lower cost by produced potable water. In this context, the present work focuses on modelling a MED process with thermosolar energy applied to the local conditions of northeastern Brazil. This region suffers from water scarcity but, on the other hand, shows the highest levels of solar radiation in Brazil. Despite that, the literature still lacks a study concerning the technical viability of operating a desalination process with solar energy in this semi-arid region. The steady-state model is based on mass and energy balances and empirical correlations from literature to calculate the enthalpy of water and brine as well as boiling point elevation and latent heat. The model is firstly validated against simulated results from the literature regarding the Plataforma Solar de Almeria. The results have shown that the implementation of a solar desalination plant in Northeast Brazil is technically feasible. The obtained model is useful for further process optimization towards minimization of investment and operational costs and to facilitate access to potable water in arid regions with high solar incidence.},

The Andasol I plant located in Granada (Spain), with a net power capacity of 50 MWe, is used as a real reference case of a concentrated solar power station. The cycle refrigerated with a cooling tower achieves a lower pressure of condensation, followed by the hybrid and dry system. As the pressure decreases, the efficiency of the cycle increases and also the power generated, being 12.60\% in the case of cooling tower and 4.65\% in the hybrid system with respect the dry condenser. A 71.74\% of water usage savings by the hybrid system carries a 7.06\% of net power production with regard of the cooling tower configuration.

  abstract = {The 21st century will witness the collision of two powerful forces – burgeoning population growth, together with a changing climate. With population growth, water scarcity will proliferate to new areas across the globe. And with climate change, rainfall will become more fickle, with longer and deeper periods of droughts and deluges.  This report presents new evidence to advance understanding on how rainfall shocks coupled with water scarcity, impacts farms, firms, and families. On farms, the largest consumers of water in the world, impacts are channeled from declining yields to changing landscapes. In cities, water extremes especially when combined with unreliable infrastructure can stall firm production, sales, and revenue. At the center of this are families, who feel the impacts of this uncertainty on their incomes, jobs, and long-term health and welfare. Although a rainfall shock may be fleeting, its consequences can become permanent and shape the destiny of those who experience it. Pursuing business as usual will lead many countries down a “parched path” where droughts shape destinies. Avoiding this misery in slow motion will call for fundamental changes to water policy around the globe. Building resilience to rainfall variability will require using different policy instruments to address the multifaceted nature of water. A key message of this report is that water has multiple economic attributes, each of which entail distinct policy responses. If water is not managed more prudently—from source, to tap, and back to source—the crises observed today will become the catastrophes of tomorrow.},

  abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) has the potential to become a leading sustainable energy technology for the European electricity system. In order to reach a substantial share in the energy mix, European investment in CSP appears most profitable in North Africa, where solar potential is significantly higher than in southern Europe. As well as sufficient solar irradiance, however, the majority of today's CSP plants also require a considerable amount of water, primarily for cooling purposes. In this paper we examine water usage associated with CSP in North Africa, and the cost penalties associated with technologies that could reduce those needs. We inspect four representative sites to compare the ecological and economical drawbacks from conventional and alternative cooling systems, depending on the local environment, and including an outlook with climate change to the mid-century. Scaling our results up to a regional level indicates that the use of wet cooling technologies would likely be unsustainable. Dry cooling systems, as well as sourcing of alternative water supplies, would allow for sustainable operation. Their cost penalty would be minor compared to the variance in CSP costs due to different average solar irradiance values.},

Since then, numerous projects have been implemented in refinery and chemical plants, and RTO has received significant attention in the industrial and academic literature. This history affords us the opportunity to assess the impact and success of RTO technology in the process industries. We begin with a discussion of the role RTO serves in the hierarchy of control and optimization decision making in the plant, and outline the key steps of the RTO layer and the coordination with MPC. Where appropriate, we point out the different approaches that have been used in practice and discuss the success factors that directly relate to the success of RTO within an organization. We also discuss alternative approaches that have been used to alleviate some of the challenges associated with implementing RTO and which may be appropriate for those unwilling to commit to the traditional RTO approach. Lastly, we provide suggestions for improvement to motivate further research.},

Every desalting system consumed either thermal, or mechanical energy or both. This paper presents a method to compare these energies on one scale that the equivalent work consumed. Based on this analysis, the energy consumed by the multi stage flash MSF system, the only system presently used in Kuwait to desalt seawater, was calculated and found equal to 25 kWh/m3. This is much higher than the energy consumed by the other two reliable systems, namely reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-effect boiling (MEB) extensively used now in many of the Arabian Gulf Countries, AGC. The average energy consumed by the RO system is 5 kWh/m3, and by the MEB is in the range of 12 kWh/m3 when steam is extracted from steam turbines at low availability.},

  abstract = {All desalting systems consume energy, either thermal or mechanical or both. In the search for energy-efficient desalting systems, it is clear that the reverse osmosis (RO) desalting system is more efficient than the widely used multi-stage flash (MSF) desalting system. For seawater in the Gulf area, as an example, RO consumes about 5 kWh/m3 of mechanical work, while MSF desalting units consume about 4 kWh/m3 pumping energy, besides thermal energy. The thermal energy input to large MSF units is in the range of 250–300 kJ/kg, and is usually in the form of slightly superheated steam extracted from steam turbines at about 2–3 bar. The equivalent work of this thermal energy is in the range of 17 kWh/m3. The conventional multi-effect boiling (MEB) desalting system uses about half of the MSF pumping energy, and almost the same amount of thermal energy used by the MSF, if both have the same gain ratio. However, a recent trend of using low-temperature MEB (LTME) allows the use of low temperature (in the range of 70°C) steam as heat source, and consequently of low exergy and low equivalent work. This can bring the LTME consumed equivalent mechanical energy close to that consumed by the efficient RO system. The conventional multieffect desalting system was revisited to show that thermal energy input to LTME is low, and can bring the equivalent mechanical energy, and thus the consumed fuel energy, to low values close to those of a seawater RO desalting system.},

The ASTM method, applied for both spiral wound and hollow fibre membrane systems, and the UOP method, applied to spiral wound membrane systems, were used in this study. The UOP method resulted in better standardization of both permeate flowrate and salt rejection for both stages of the spiral wound membrane system configuration. For a plant operation time of 36 months, the average differnece between both methods was 1.2\% and 5.8\% for the salt rejection of first and second stage respectively and 8.0\% nd 4.6\% for the permeate flowrate of first and secons stage respectively. The UOP method does need, however, more detailed input data compared to the ASTM method. An attempt was made to modify the UOP method for application with the hollow fibre membrane system configuration. A smaller difference range for salt rejection was obtained, ranging between 0.8\% for the first stage and 2.0\% for the second stage. On the other hand, the average difference between the two methods was 15.3\% and 9.4\% for the permeate flowrate leaving the first and second stage respectively. The standardized performance data using UOP method were closer to the plant design data.},

  abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of EMO.},

Photo-Fenton was carried out in a solar simulator at pH of 3 and at natural pH using Ethylenediamine-N, N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) as an iron complexing agent. Degradation efficacy was tested with MCs commonly found in urban wastewater treatment plant effluents (caffeine, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, carbamazepine and diclofenac). Hydrogen peroxide and persulfate were compared in solar processes. Increase in salinity and pressure had a negligible influence on MC permeability order and NF selectivity. Solar photo-Fenton was able to degrade MCs present in the concentrated stream, and rapidly eliminate any residual MCs that might finally be present in permeate streams. Persulfate used instead of hydrogen peroxide was shown to be inefficient for the selected MCs. Fe(III):EDDS at circumneutral pH was able to remove MCs as quickly as classical photo-Fenton at acid pH, or even faster. This effect supports use of Fe(III):EDDS at natural pH for treating NF concentrates or polishing NF permeates when NF membranes are operated under extreme conditions of salinity.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the technological development of solar thermal technologies through the analysis of patent records and search traffic. First, various solar thermal technologies are reviewed and discussed. Then, the related published patents are analysed. To improve the accuracy of patents retrieval, a new framework is proposed and employed based on the combination of keywords and keycodes. In this new framework, the proposed methodology can enhance the retrieved patent pool resolution by eliminating the patent with the relevant title but irrelevant technology scopes. Furthermore, new technological features such as technology attractiveness and acceleration are introduced and applied to solar thermal technologies. These two introduced features help to recognize interested areas by industrial players in the technological field. The pace of technology being developed and becoming matured could be identified by how fast the industry invests in technology by protecting its intellectual properties. The logistic S-curve is employed for assessing the current state of solar technologies on the technology life cycle. The market diffusion of each solar thermal technology is assessed by developing adoption curves using search traffic. Finally, the hype cycle of solar thermal technologies is demonstrated by combining the two technological assessment graphs. Through the proposed methodology, 8740 related patents are retrieved and screened. The analysis shows that Photovoltaic-thermal has the highest share in published patents and the parabolic trough and evacuated tube collectors are in their maturity phase. The parabolic dish collector is identified as one of the highest accelerated technologies and also located near the maturity phase. Therefore, it can be predicted that the next technology reaching the maturity phase would be the parabolic dish collector. Overall, all solar-heat driver cycles are in their growth stage, but the Rankine cycle is more developed. Text analysis determines the main challenge with cycles is the operation and maintenance that should be overcome to meet the maturity phase.},

  abstract = {La creciente demanda energética, el agotamiento de las reservas de combustibles fósiles y la amenaza de la irreversibilidad del cambio climático urgen a encontrar una solución al problema energético al que nos enfrentamos. Las energías renovables son una prometedora alternativa como fuentes de energías limpias y virtualmente inagotables. Entre ellas, hay una que motiva esta tesis: la energía solar térmica. Esta tiene la capacidad de poder reemplazar en su mayor parte a los combustibles fósiles en numerosos procesos industriales. Los tipos de procesos térmicos a los que pueden ser acopladas las plantas termosolares son muy diversos. Pero a pesar de las diferencias que existan entre ellos, los principios y leyes fundamentales que los rigen son comunes. El foco de atención de este documento son los procesos que interrelacionan calor y trabajo con reacciones químicas y cambios de fase, también llamados procesos termoquímicos. El método de estudio de este tipo de procesos es a través del modelado y simulación de sistemas dinámicos, una herramienta capaz de resolver problemas complejos. Precisamente, la contribución original de esta tesis pretende ser un avance en esta técnica aplicada a los procesos termoquímicos que se dan en las instalaciones termosolares. Para ello, primero se revisa la herramienta. Los conceptos básicos de modelado son expuestos y se destaca la metodología de modelado orientado a objetos como la mejor opción para resolver sistemas complejos. A continuación, se estudian los principales problemas que se originan en la simulación cuando se emplea este tipo de metodología, i.e. la partición, los lazos algebraicos y las singularidades, y se analizan algunos algoritmos para su resolución. Se presenta el lenguaje de modelado con el que se ha trabajado, Modelica, y su entorno de simulación, Dymola. El siguiente paso es revisar la disciplina científica que se desea modelar. Se introduce la termodinámica química partiendo de los principios y leyes empíricas fundamentales hasta llegar a los desarrollos matemáticos de los principales fenómenos que aquí se tratan, i.e. las reacciones químicas y los cambios de fase. Con ello, se consigue dar un contexto físico y matemático apropiado para poder comprender y mejorar los modelos de este tipo de procesos. El conocimiento adquirido con ambos estudios, herramienta y disciplina científica, se pone en práctica en tres procesos de diferente naturaleza: la producción de hidrógeno con ciclos termoquímicos de ruptura del agua, la recuperación de la energía por medio de una bomba de calor de tecnología de absorción y la desalinización de agua salobre mediante la destilación multiefecto. Los modelos de estos tres procesos, asociados con plantas de energía solar térmica, están basados en tres instalaciones reales situadas en CIEMAT-Plataforma Solar de Almería. El objetivo de los trabajos de modelado y simulación para estos sistemas tiene una finalidad muy concreta: que permitan estudiar el comportamiento de las instalaciones en diferentes escenarios y que puedan emplearse para el diseño de sistemas de control avanzado que mejoren la operación de las plantas. Es por ello por lo que los modelos desarrollados deben cumplir con unos requisitos de precisión y esfuerzo computacional determinados. En la planta de generación de hidrógeno se analiza la dinámica de las reacciones químicas. Esta instalación se basa en la ruptura de la molécula de agua mediante un proceso termoquímico de dos pasos con dos reacciones, una de reducción y otra de oxidación. Para que estas tengan lugar es necesaria una cantidad concreta de potencia térmica, que en este caso, es proporcionada por un campo de heliostatos. Los otros dos sistemas, la bomba de calor y la planta de destilación multiefecto, han permitido analizar la dinámica de los cambios de fase tanto de un fluido monocompuesto (evaporación y condensación) como de uno multicompuesto (absorción y desorción). El primer sistema basa su tecnología en la capacidad que tienen ciertos fluidos líquidos de absorber-desorber vapor a diferentes temperaturas que las de evaporación-condensación de ese vapor. Gracias a esta tecnología se puede extraer calor de un foco frío y cederlo a uno más caliente. Su uso permite recuperar parte del calor perdido por determinados procesos industriales, como por ejemplo la destilación multiefecto. Esta, a su vez, basa su tecnología en una serie de procesos de evaporación y condensación que tienen lugar en una secuencia decreciente de presiones y temperaturas. El acople a gran escala de este tipo de tecnología con plantas termosolares es una prometedora solución en regiones áridas costeras con altos niveles de insolación.  Cada uno de estos ejemplos prácticos ha sido tratado de la misma forma: primero se hace una breve introducción del proceso y se revisan los últimos avances del estado de la tecnología, se describe la planta experimental en la que se basa, se presenta un modelo orientado a objetos, modular y jerárquico del sistema y se finaliza analizando las simulaciones con una calibración y una validación frente a datos experimentales.},

The steam turbine is responsible for power production while the gas turbine works mainly as a combustion chamber. In the South of Spain, an excess of biogas is available during summer yielding a production cost of electricity of 0.17 €/kWh with an investment of 380\,M€ for a production facility of 25\,MW. This plant is not yet economic.},

  abstract = {Nuclear fission reaction is a clean energy source that can provide thermal power to desalination processes for producing potable water. Due to the inherent safety features of the integral pressurized water reactor (iPWRs) and economic competitiveness of the multi-effect-desalination and thermal-vapor-compression (MED-TVC) process, it is reasonable to interconnect the iPWR with MED-TVC process to develop nuclear desalination plants (NDPs). Dynamic modeling is important for both the design and optimization of the control systems for nuclear desalination plants. In this paper, based on the balance of mass, momentum, energy and salt, a lumped-parameter dynamic model for the NDP composed of an iPWR named NHR-200II and the MED-TVC process is given for the plant control design, which is further deployed as a program on Matlab/Simulink platform. For the modeling verification, the steady points of some key process variables are shown with comparison to the design data, and the open-loop responses under the stepping of both the input seawater flowrate and TVC throat cross-section area are given, which not only show accuracy of this model but also illustrate the coupling between the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) and MED-TVC modules. Then, a plant control strategy of the NDP based upon NHR-200II reactor and MED-TVC module is newly proposed. Based on the dynamic model, the control verification is finally performed, and the closed-loop responses in the cases of both power maneuvering and MED-TVC module bypassing show the feasibility and satisfactory performance of this control design.},

  abstract = {This paper surveys economic assessments of concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies and finds two dominant assessment methods. A majority of studies reported in the literature are based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), while a small subset of studies consider time-varying meteorological and electricity market conditions. Several studies argue that LCOE undervalues dynamic flexibility provided by thermal energy storage and does not consider revenue opportunities provided by electricity markets at different time scales. As a result, some studies find that both LCOE and revenue can in fact be conflicting metrics for certain designs and market conditions. This review finds strong variations in LCOE and revenue estimates in the literature. As comparisons between CSP and other generation technologies (e.g., fossil, wind, and photovoltaic) are dictated by the chosen economic metric, it is imperative that policy and investment decisions should carefully consider time-varying effects and flexibility. Finally, research directions are proposed to increasing the fidelity of economic assessments and to mitigate discrepancies.},

  abstract = {The rapid global growth in the use of renewable energy to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change, through the inclusion of large amounts of PV and wind in existing electricity grids, has highlighted certain challenges. Most critically, their intermittent supply, necessitates flexible dispatchability from other generators in the grid. Currently, few renewable energy technologies offer this dispatchability, with only concentrating solar power (CSP) offering storage. CSP generates electricity from thermal heat, similar to fossil-driven thermal power plants, with the heat-source being inexhaustible concentrated solar irradiance. The thermal process, however, requires cooling, best achieved with a finite resource; water. CSP is ideally suited to areas of high solar irradiation, typically arid and water stressed. The need for water as a source of cooling is often neglected in the planning and development of CSP. This paper identifies water as a constraint to CSP deployment, and explores CSP's potential contribution to generation through the lens of the water-energy nexus. This aids our understanding of how water availability threatens expected CSP production capacity and places natural limits on its sustainable development. For strategic planning of CSP, we therefore propose the inclusion of integrated water resource management in CSP energy infrastructure planning.},

These two alternatives have a trade off: cooling tower evaporative cooling systems use water, which is a scarce resource in the desert environments where CSP is implemented, but air-cooling results in decreased power plant performance. In this paper, a radiation-enhanced cooling system for thermal power plants is analyzed with a detailed heat transfer model and shown to be feasible for CSP. The proposed system consumes no water and has the potential to out-perform air-cooling. Heat transfer occurs by convection and radiation to the cold night temperatures of desert environments. The radiators are uncovered black panels with tubes of cooling fluid circulated to a cold storage system. The radiators’ performance is modeled using a two-dimensional finite difference model and the complete power plant system is modeled on an hourly basis using a standard power plant with thermal energy storage. If the night sky cooling system is the same size as the solar collector field, annual simulation shows that the system can provide over 90\% of the required cooling. In addition, performance is improved compared to traditional air-cooling because the parasitic load for circulating water in the radiator system is about 1\% of gross energy production while the parasitic load for an air-cooled power plant is about 4\%. The night sky cooling system is a potential solution to the water issues that face CSP power plants and other power plants located in desert environments.},

  abstract = {In this study, a mathematical model is developed, coupling mass transfer with chemical reaction, to calculate alkaline scale formation from simultaneous desorption–deposition of CO2–CaCO3 from evaporation of water falling film in horizontal-tube multiple-effect (ME) distillers. The saturation levels, calculated by the Oddo–Tomson saturation index (OTSI) and by the calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP), are found to be positive which indicate scaling conditions. The effect of top brine temperature (TBT), concentration factor (CF), pH and salinity on CaCO3 deposition rates, scale thickness and fouling resistance (Rf) are fully described and interpreted. In addition, their effect on the CO2 desorption rates is also discussed. The amount of CO2 desorbed decreases from 36.4 g/ton feed water in the first stage to 32.5 g/ton in the last stage. The specific CaCO3 deposition decreases from 127.3 g/ton feed water in the first stage to 100.1 g/ton in the last stage. This corresponds to an average alkaline scale thickness of 165–130 μm and fouling resistance of 0.31–0.25 m2K/kW. CaCO3 deposition rates increase with increasing top brine temperature, salinity and concentration factor and decrease with increasing pH values of the seawater.},

It is observed that the global installed desalination capacity has been increasing steadily at the rate of about 7\% per annum since year 2010 to the end of 2019. Extra-large plants are few but they supply most of the global desalination capacity. There is a sharp rise in the desalination capacities of regions that did not really embrace desalination in the past, including Europe and Africa. The power industry remains the largest owner of installed capacity for industrial purposes. Filtration and dissolved air flotation remains the most prominent pretreatment methods. Seawater and Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) model are the most frequently used feed water and plant delivery method, accounting for 57\% and 71.7\% of global installed capacity, respectively. This assessment also reveals that capital cost accounts for a larger share of the specific cost of water production. The understanding of the trends is useful to make informed choices for the development of future desalination projects and research.},

As the industry expands there is a pressing need to have a clear and well-written textbook that focuses on desalination fundamentals and other industrial aspects. This book focuses on the processes widely used in industry, which include multistage flash desalination and reverse osmosis. Also, other desalination processes with attractive features and high potential are featured.  It includes a large number of solved examples, which are explained in simple and careful matter that allow the reader to follow and understand the development. The data used in the development of the examples and case studies are extracted from existing desalination plants. This title also includes comparisons of model predictions against results reported in literature as well as available experimental and industrial data. Several industries include similar unit operation processes, i.e., evaporators, condensers, flashing units, membrane separation, and chemical treatment. Examples of such industries include wastewater treatment, food, petroleum, petrochemical, power generation, and pulp and paper.

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling of the multiple effect evaporation (MEE) desalination process has been carried out to determine the effects of the important design and operating variables on the parameters controlling the cost of producing fresh water. The model assumes the practical case of constant heat transfer areas for both the evaporators and feed preheaters in all effects. In addition, the model considered the impact of the vapor leak in the venting system, the variation in thermodynamic losses from one effect to another, the dependence of the physical properties of water on salinity and temperature, and the influence of noncondensable gases on the heat transfer coefficients in the evaporators and the feed preheaters. The modified fixed-point iterative procedure is used to solve the large number of highly nonlinear equations describing the MEE desalting system. The algorithm consists of 10 calculation blocks and 6 logical blocks. The algorithm is implemented using L-A-S computer aided language. Results show that the heat transfer coefficients increase with the boiling temperature. Also, the heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator is always higher than that in the feed preheater at the same boiling temperature. The plant thermal performance ratio is nearly independent of the top brine temperature and strongly related to the number of effects. The specific heat transfer area increases by raising the number of effects and reducing the top brine temperature. The effect of the top brine temperature on the specific heat transfer area is more pronounced with a larger number of effects. The required specific heat transfer areas at a top brine temperature of 100°C are 30.3\% and 26\% of that required at 60°C when the number of effects are 6 and 12, respectively. The specific flow rate of cooling water is nearly constant at different values of top brine temperature and tapers off at a high rate as the number of effects is increased. Two correlations are developed to relate the heat transfer coefficients in the preheater and the evaporator to the boiling temperature. Design correlations are also developed to describe variations in the plant thermal performance, the specific heat transfer area, and the specific flow rate of cooling water in terms of the top brine temperature and the number of effects.},

  abstract = {In recent years, numerous large-scale seawater desalination plants have been built in water-stressed countries to augment available water resources, and construction of new desalination plants is expected to increase in the near future. Despite major advancements in desalination technologies, seawater desalination is still more energy intensive compared to conventional technologies for the treatment of fresh water. There are also concerns about the potential environmental impacts of large-scale seawater desalination plants. Here, we review the possible reductions in energy demand by state-of-the-art seawater desalination technologies, the potential role of advanced materials and innovative technologies in improving performance, and the sustainability of desalination as a technological solution to global water shortages.}

  abstract = {Cooling towers are indispensable components for heat rejection in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. However, the overall performance of CSP plants relies heavily on the choice of cooling tower technology. This paper aims at assessing the impact of cooling tower technology on CSP plant from performance, economic, and environmental perspectives. To achieve this goal, seven CSP projects worldwide with distinct features were selected, and multiple simulations on System Advisor Model software were performed to evaluate the annual energy production, capacity factor, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Moreover, the impact assessment was performed in terms of key metrics, such as discounted payback period (DPP), savings-to-investment ratio (SIR), greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, water-saving, and total costs savings (TCS) including energy, carbon and water costs savings. The results showed that the wet cooling technology achieved the highest performance findings followed by hybrid and dry cooling technologies. The environmental analysis revealed that the wet cooling technology could avoid roughly 7.02\% and 2.93\% of GHG emissions compared to dry and hybrid cooling ones, respectively; however, it was found that dry and hybrid cooling technologies could be more profitable in arid regions with water scarcity, since they could save on average 93.30\% and 69.83\% of water, respectively, compared to the wet technology. Furthermore, the economic results showed that wet and hybrid cooling towers exhibit the best cost-effectiveness over dry cooling one as the LCOE was found to be \$0.231/0.244 per kWh, and the DPP ranged between 13.41 and 23.46/14.95 and 34.75~years by integrating wet/hybrid technologies in CSP plants. Overall, wet and hybrid cooling technologies yield better TCS and SIR outcomes over dry cooling one. However, with respect to energy conservation, water savings, and GHG emissions savings, hybrid cooling tower could be considered as an optimal technology. This paper is expected to be a guideline for selecting the most cost-effective and eco-friendly cooling technology for future CSP plants, based on key criteria.},

  abstract = {Desalination is currently considered as a reliable nonconventional freshwater supply, which has been practiced on a large scale for many decades. Nevertheless, desalination is generally the most energy-intensive and costly water treatment process. The current desalination capacity of 38 billion cubic meters per day (BCM/d), consuming energy of almost 75 TWh. Fossil fuel, such as coal, oil, and gas, is the primary energy source to drive different desalination processes for both thermal and electrical energy demand. However, the extensive use of fossil fuel has been related to global warming and climate change, hence raised many calls to reduce its consumption, develop high-efficiency energy processes, and better utilization of fuel and energy. It has been estimated that 20–50\% of the energy used globally is wasted as heat; thus, it represents a good opportunity for energy recovery, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Waste heat (WH) has a high potential to fully or partially drive different desalination processes either as heat or after recovery and conversion into electrical or mechanical energy forms. This review is the first of its type to discuss the effort in utilizing WH in desalination processes and its recent advances. The review discusses the WH sources and types, as well as recovery systems relative to their utilization in desalination processes. Then the different desalination processes relative to their potential to be driven by WH utilization are thoroughly discussed, with focus is being given to emerging desalination due to the many benefits driving their development. It was found that WH has successfully been used to drive different desalination processes, with the main effort given to the direct utilization of heat to drive different thermally-driven desalination processes. The utilization of WH has proven to bring significant economic and environmental benefits hence lowering desalination cost and associated greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Other mechanically-driven, and electrically-driven processes, can be found in the contexts of waste-to-power energy recovery systems, which can be later used to drive such processes. Although WH has been successfully employed for desalination, we conclude that still more efforts need for research, development, and demonstration (RD\&D) in this field, which should be addressed in the near future as it presents a good opportunity to secure energy supply for increasing water demand.},

  abstract = {The current study describes a detailed steady-state analysis and transient operation of a multi-effect desalination plant with a thermal vapor compressor unit (MED-TVC). The model developed is based on solving the basic conservation equations of mass, energy, and salt. It can predict steady-state operation and transient behavior when the plant is subject to abrupt changes in the main input parameters including motive steam flow rate (mms), cooling seawater flow rate (mcw) and cooling seawater temperature (Tcw). These sudden changes simulate the conditions a MED-TVC plant may be exposed to. Both the steady-state and dynamic aspects of the model are validated against published experimental data. Monitoring the variation of four state variables (vapor temperature, brine level, brine and vapor flow rates) in each effect shows that disturbances in the motive steam flow rate and the cooling seawater temperature have a significant effect on the plant performance. On the other hand, the disturbance in the cooling seawater mass flow rate has only a moderate effect. For all applied disturbances, the change in the brine level is the slowest compared to the changes in vapor temperature, and brine and vapor flow rates. Furthermore, the effect of changing seawater salinity shows a slight effect on the total distillate production and the specific heat transfer area.},

  abstract = {Four different configurations of Multi-Effect-Desalination (MED): backward feed (BF), forward feed (FF), parallel feed (PF) and parallel/cross feed (PCF) are modeled in steady and dynamic operation to examine the behavior of these configurations under transient operation. Adding thermal vapor compressor (TVC) unit with the last effect of parallel/cross configuration is also studied and compared to the other configurations to show the advantage of this type of integration. The transient operation is achieved by applying ramp changes (disturbances) in the main input parameters that include steam flow rate at the heat source and cooling seawater temperature and flow rate at the heat sink. Steady state results indicate that parallel/cross feed has a relatively better performance characteristic than the other feed configurations regarding Gain Output Ratio (GOR) and specific heat consumption (SHC). Adding TVC unit to the parallel/cross feed achieves the lowest water production cost. Dynamic results show that MED-TVC with parallel/cross feed has the fastest response while backward feed and forward feed have the slower response to the applied disturbances. In the case of heat source disturbance, MED plants operating in the backward feed arrangement may be exposed to shut down due to the significant increase in brine level for the first effect. The MED-TVC process is susceptible to the heat sink disturbances compared to the PCF and other configurations. Also, changes in input parameters lead to the highest reduction in GOR for the MED-TVC process compared to the different configurations, especially for cooling seawater temperature. The highest reduction in brine level occurs in MED-TVC for a disturbance in the cooling seawater flow rate and may lead to MED-TVC evaporator drying condition. Hence, MED-TVC will require a reliable control system to avoid this type of plant operational disturbance.},

The chapter presents the generalized exergy analysis where the open system can also experience mass transfer with the environment. It considers the thermodynamics of air-conditioning processes and systems. The working fluid is atmospheric air, which, as a first approximation, can be viewed as a two-component mixture of dry air and water vapor. The chapter also talks about mixtures of air and water vapor, total flow exergy of humid air, and total flow exergy of liquid water.},

The performance of the method has been examined by its application to a set of eleven test cases from the specialized literature. The results have been compared with previously published results from the literature. It is shown that the method is able to find the optimum solutions. The proposed method requires no parameter tuning and can be used as a fitness evaluator with any evolutionary algorithm.

  abstract = {The importance of considering the water price in the analysis of the impact of dry versus hybrid condensing systems in the thermo economical performance of solar tower plants was demonstrated in this work. The dry condensing system consists of several induced-draft air-cooled condenser cells (ACCs) and the hybrid system consists of a parallel system where the condensing steam is split between the ACCs and a surface steam condenser where circulating water is cooled in a wet mechanical-draft cooling tower. The influence of the operating parameters of either the dry or wet cooling systems on the cooling load and fan power consumption were studied. Then, for a given condensing system (a system with a defined number of installed ACCs units and cooling tower units) and given the dry-air and wet-bulb air temperatures, the operating parameters were optimized to maximize the revenues of the power plant. This optimization depends on the water-to-electricity price ratio R, showing that at low ambient temperature when this ratio increases it is not profitable to turn on the cooling towers since the water cost is not counterbalanced by the higher cycle efficiency obtained with the lower condensation temperature. Finally, the annual operation and the LCOE and NPV of the CSP plant located in Dunhuang were analyzed for both dry and hybrid condensing systems with different number of ACCs and wet towers, showing that the most cost-effective configuration is the 16 ACCs with 3 wet cooling towers for water-to-electricity price ratio R=4 (\$/m3)/(\$/kWhe) and R=5 (\$/m3)/(\$/kWhe), but for R=10 (\$/m3)/(\$/kWhe), the best option is with only 2 wet towers.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, model predictive control (MPC) has shown outstanding performance for control tasks from various domains. This performance has further improved in recent years with advanced MPC schemes for nonlinear systems under uncertainty including economic control objectives. These recent improvements often fail to bridge the gap between MPC researchers and control practitioners in academia and industry, where classical control approaches and traditional linear MPC still dominate most applications. This is despite the fact that advanced MPC controllers can lead to significant energy savings, yield improvements, safer operation and other benefits. In this work, we identify four main obstacles hindering the widespread adoption of advanced MPC methods. These are the unavailability of models, the challenges associated with deploying complex controllers on physical systems, the scarcity of rapid prototyping tools for advanced methods and the limited reproducibility and reusability of advanced MPC controllers and their results. We find that the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) for scientific data-management and research software can play an important role in tackling these obstacles. Following these guidelines, we discuss FAIR solutions and present the open-source software do-mpc as a concrete implementation. The presented solutions include interoperability with neural network toolboxes to simplify nonlinear system identification, interoperability with the OPC UA communication protocol for deployment, and a reproducible data-sampling framework for transparent controller validation, system identification and approximate MPC. The potential of the proposed solutions is illustrated with several simulation studies.},

  abstract = {In the literature, several exergy analysis approaches have been proposed to investigate desalination processes. It is not clear, however, which approach is the most appropriate or indeed whether all approaches are valid. The objective of this paper is to review the various methods and to critically assess their assumptions, limitations, advantages and disadvantages. The main focus of this work is the chemical exergy term. Several exergy calculation models were examined and compared using a dataset from the literature. In addition, an accurate approach to calculate the chemical exergy of electrolyte solutions, based on the Pitzer equations, was proposed. The models assessed were: (1) the ideal mixture model (NaCl and water), (2) the ideal mixture model (seawater salt and water), (3) the Sharqawy seawater functions, and (4) the electrolyte solution model (Pitzer equations, NaCl and water), (5) the model used by Drioli et al. and (6) the dissociated ion approach (NaCl and water). Four of the six approaches produced very similar results. Moreover, one other exergy calculation method was found to have serious limitations. The findings presented here show that the choice of exergy model can have a significant impact on the results obtained and that considerable care must be taken to select the most suitable approach.},

However, there are still some possibili ties of devising new heuristic algorithms based on analogies with natural or artificial phenom ena. A new heuristic algorithm, mimicking the improvisation of music players, has been devel oped and named Harmony Search (HS).

The goal is to develop innovative and cost-effective technology for high salt concentration sea water desalination using renewable energy technologies. The main objectives are to develop sustainable methods and strategies to enhance the quality and quantity of freshwater production; and reduce the energy consumption during the desalination process. The effect of number of stages for the Multi Effect Distillation (MED) system, the addition of the adsorption desalination (AD) stage and the heat recovery from the residual brines on the performance of the MEDAD system for high salinity sea water under hot and humid climatic conditions are investigated. The analytical analysis and an optimization method are used in this study to determine the system’s optimum operating conditions to maximize the freshwater production, reduce the energy consumption and performance ratio. Four input factors are selected for the parametric study: Heat transfer fluid temperature and Reynolds number; and sea water temperature and total dissolved solids TDS. The results show that the production rate of fresh water was improved by 2.68 times, achieving a 57.78\% lower specific energy consumption by adding the adsorption desalination stage. For the heat recovery from the residual brine, the results show that the freshwater production rate and the performance ratio increased by respectively 14.73\% and 12.86\%, and the specific energy consumption decreased by 11.34\%. New correlations for the variation of the inverse of the specific energy consumption (m3/kWh) and the performance ratio versus the four input factors and the order of importance of the input factors are presented.},

  abstract = {The high thermal energy consumption is one of the main drawbacks hampering the commercial implementation of Membrane Distillation (MD) technology. The development of adequate operating strategies can help to reduce these energy requirements. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the optimal management of the array of MD modules composing a commercial-scale MD plant, trying to reduce their thermal energy consumption while ensuring a given water need. For this aim, the array of MD modules is modelled as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) system to consider that some modules can be turned on/off depending on the operation specifications. An algorithm based on the Generalized Bender Decomposition (GBD) is then developed for the efficient solution of the problem. This algorithm is incorporated in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy allowing to manage the plant in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using a practical example. The obtained results are compared with a manual and a previous strategy presented in literature, showing that for a sunny day, around the 65 and 55\% of the thermal energy consumed by these methodologies can be saved, which means important thermal energy savings that can be relevant for the industrial implementation of MD technology.},

From the dynamical point of view, the start-up phase is relevant since if the storage device is unloaded in terms of energy or widely stratified, the transitory regime can take long time until reaching the operating point. In this paper, an optimal real-time procedure based on a hierarchical controller for improving the start-up phase is proposed. The hierarchical controller is composed of two layers based on a Model Predictive Control~(MPC) technique and Proportional Integer Derivative~(PID) controllers. Real experimental tests were performed in a pilot facility located at Plataforma Solar de Almería (Almería, Spain). In addition, a comparison in simulation with the typical manual procedure and with two techniques proposed previously in the literature for the same plant is provided. The results demonstrate the benefits obtained by using the proposed method; since it reduces the start-up phase in 34~[min] in comparison with the manual operation, and in 26 and 6~[min] with respect to the two previous techniques.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a hybrid control strategy for the optimal operation of a solar membrane distillation facility This kind of plants presents a hybrid nature allowing their operation in several modes, which must be properly selected according to the operating conditions. Thus, the control algorithm is based on a mixed logical dynamical characterization of the solar membrane distillation facility, combined with the application of a practical nonlinear model predictive control strategy for calculating the optimal control actions. The main objectives of the control system are to increase the operating temperature and the distillate production of the membrane distillation module, as well as the number of operational hours. For these goals, the control algorithm has to select the most appropriate operating mode and the optimal operating points in terms of water flow rate at each sampling time. Simulation results are presented for evidencing the benefits of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract = {In the context of material synthesis and thermal stress tests, solar furnaces play a fundamental role. These experimental systems are usually operated manually by trained operators. However, the use of automatic controllers can be essential to take into account the different dynamics of the treated materials, follow the different temperature profiles required in the tests, meet system security requirements, and face the intermittency of the main energy source, the solar energy. On these bases, the present work proposes a control system for temperature regulation in solar furnaces. The controller is based on a nonlinear model predictive control strategy that deals, in a single control layer, with the nonlinear behaviour of the system, the effect of disturbances, and the system's operating constraints. The controller was experimentally tested in the solar furnace SF60 of Plataforma Solar de Almería (southeast Spain), showing adequate performance against setpoint temperature changes, reaching a settling time of the order of 54 \% faster than the open-loop system's time constant, and effectively rejecting irradiance disturbances. In addition, the operational constraints were ensured in almost all operating circumstances, observing only slight deviations of less than 2°C. These results allow us to position the proposed controller as a relevant tool for daily operation.},

  abstract = {Desalting brines from Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants is one of the most promising applications of Membrane Distillation (MD) systems. The development of accurate models to predict MD system performances plays a significant role in the design of this kind of industrial applications. In this paper, a commercial-scale PermeateGap Membrane Distillation (PGMD) module was modelled by means of two different approaches: Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Condenser inlet temperature, evaporator inlet temperature, feed flow rate and feed water salt concentration were selected as inputs of the model, while permeate flux and Specific Thermal Energy Consumption (STEC) were chosen as responses. The prediction abilities of both RSM and ANN models were compared with further experimental data by using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results show that the ANN model is able to predict in a more precise way the behaviour of the module for the whole range of input variables. Thus, ANN model was used to find the optimal operating conditions, for the module operating at feed water salinity of 70 and 105 g/L, concentrations that can be reached when desalting RO brines.},

  abstract = {The use of solar thermal systems to produce heat for industrial processes is a feasible option that is gaining increasing interest in recent years as an initiative toward the zero-carbon energy future. This technology has a place in different processes, yet there is still no consensus on the main methods for sizing or controlling. The design requires the use of specific techniques due to the inconstant nature of solar energy as well as the heterogeneity of some industrial thermal demands. Nevertheless, despite starting from a particular system’s design, the dynamic together with the hybrid and nonlinear behavior of the processes involved require adequate control techniques to provide the energy in a usable form and keep the system operating close to the design specifications. This paper presents a literature review concerning research works that address the design and control of solar thermal systems used in industrial contexts. The main objective is to analyze the different techniques used and to highlight their limits, usefulness, and the various industrial sectors where they were applied. The results of this analysis can be seen as a decision-making tool to select the most appropriate design or control strategy for these applications. It has been found that control techniques such as model predictive control can improve key performance metrics in daily operation. However, further development on these kinds of techniques and in holistic optimization methods that exploit the synergies between the operational and design phases is required.},

  abstract = {Solar thermal fields are usually coupled to storage tanks to improve the energy dispatchability. In direct configuration and without an auxiliary energy source, the state of the storage tank at the beginning of the operation is very relevant. If the storage device is stratified or discharged in terms of energy, the start-up phase until reaching the desired operating point can take a long time and reduce the benefits. Consequently, this paper presents a two-layer hierarchical controller aimed at reducing the costs and time spent in this operating phase. The upper layer is based on a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy, and the lower one is composed of Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers. The proposed technique was applied to a real facility located at Plataforma Solar de Almería (southest of Spain). Moreover, a comparative simulation study with manual and previous approaches proposed in literature was performed to evidence the important economic and time savings achieved by the application of the developed technique.},

Polymer composite grades based on polypropylene and polyphenylene sulphide filled with graphite have been developed by Technoform Kunststoffprofile GmbH (Lohfelden, Germany). A special extrusion process allows high filler loadings of up to 60 vol\% and the orientation of filler particles in the polymer matrix to reach enhanced thermal conductivities in the radial direction. Thermal and mechanical properties, chemical resistance to various acids and alkaline media, lifetime behaviour, heat transfer performance and fouling behaviour were studied for composites with 50 vol\% graphite. The extruded polymer composite tubes have a thermal conductivity of about 13–20~W/(m~K) which is around 50–100 times higher than that of standard polymers and is comparable to stainless steel grades. The excellent chemical resistance, low weight, good processability as well as highly promising initial test rig results in fouling studies compared to corrosion-resistant metals open up cost-efficient opportunities for heat exchangers in various industries such as chemical, petrochemical, oil and gas, food and beverage, and seawater desalination industries. Important design aspects such as various possibilities of mounting the polymer composite tubes in the tube plates and the maximum unsupported tube span for avoiding tube failures by flow-induced vibrations are discussed. A potential enhancement of heat transfer by shaping polymer composite tubes other than circular plain tubes and the construction of fully polymer-based heat exchangers will be in the focus of future development.},

  abstract = {In multiple-effect distillers (MEDs) with horizontal tube falling film evaporators, difficult-to-control scale is formed on the outside of the tubes, causing considerable capital, operating, and maintenance costs. Because seawater is a multicomponent electrolyte solution, scale formation is primarily caused by coprecipitation of inorganic salts, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium sulphate, which are insoluble at elevated temperatures. Therefore, solubility data and rate constants obtained under single-salt precipitation are not applicable. The presence of another precipitating salt in the solution affects the precipitation thermodynamics and kinetics, as well as scale structure and strength. Because the scaling process is complex, research primarily has been restricted to single-salt precipitation. A horizontal tube falling film evaporator in pilot-plant scale was used to study scale formation under conditions approximating industrial MEDs at an evaporation temperature of 75 °C, exceeding the top brine temperatures currently used in MEDs. To investigate the interactive effect of mixed salts, experiments were conducted with artificial seawater and model-solutions based on artificial seawater with varying calcium or magnesium concentrations. Scale on the outside of horizontal tubes was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and atomic absorption spectroscopy to obtain structural, chemical, and quantitative information.},

The existence of temperature constraints for consumers connected to the hybrid cooling tower, Space constraints for the construction of auxiliary system, devoting attention to high Net Present Value (NPV) of the project over the course of 25\,years, Returning the appropriate capital, Optimal Design of air cooler and it's desirable performance over the course of a year were the reasons led to use of the genetic algorithm (GA) in this paper. The GA should optimize the design of the air cooler, according to that, at one functional point of a year, the lowest investment costs and the lowest cost of utilization in one year will happen. The cost of utilization in this project including: water consumption (makeup water of the cycle), fan power consumption (wet and dry block of hybrid cooling system), as well as chemical additives to water. The results illustrated that the proposed algorithm usage, applying a proper control system, taking into account the standards in the written code and determining the optimization intervals according to the manufacturer's data could conclude to the design of an air cooler, which can be constructed by inquiring from the manufacturing companies. The results also indicated that optimized design of hybrid cooling tower could reduce water consumption about 63\% over the course of one year, return on investment by 5\,years, develop NPV up to 40\,M€ and enhance steam turbine power.},

On the contrary to the iterative approach employing mathematical programming, we focus on adjustment of genetic algorithm which builds the Pareto front by updating an elite set of individuals. As the genetic algorithm belongs to the family of metaheuristics, it is commonly awaited that its performance is very sensitive to setting of its parameters. That is why the focus of this paper is devoted to such method of parameter setting, which is most suitable for efficient estimate Pareto front determination by the genetic algorithm.},

  abstract = {Direct use and power generation based on geothermal sources are growing at a steadfast pace around the world. Although available abundantly in many parts of the world, geothermal energy sources have been under-utilized in desalination applications. Geothermal sources have the potential to serve as excellent heat sources for thermal desalination processes. Since thermal desalination processes require large quantities of heat sources, geothermal based energy source represents a feasible, sustainable, and an environmentally friendly option. The advantage with geothermal source is that it can act as a heat source and a storage medium for process energy utilization. If these water sources have high dissolved solids, then they can serve as feed water for the desalination process. Since external energy consumption is minimized except for the mechanical energy requirements, geothermal enabled desalination processes could have less environmental impacts when compared to other nonrenewable energy driven desalination processes. Cogeneration schemes for simultaneous water and power production are also possible with geothermal sources as well as poly generation with multiple process benefits involving cooling and heating applications. This paper provides the present state-of-the-art of geothermal desalination with discussion on the benefits of geothermal desalination over other renewable and nonrenewable energy driven desalination configurations. Present status of the worldwide geothermal desalination and the potential for future developments in this technological area were discussed in detail with case studies for Australia, Caribbean Islands, Central America (Coasta Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama), India, Israel, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, USA, and Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Two types of power cycles, a regenerative Rankine cycle, representing biomass and solar thermal plants, and the combined cycle, corresponding to biogas or gasification based processes, are studied. The facilities are modeled unit by unit in detail to compute the cycle yield, the condenser duty, the water consumption and the natural draft wet cooling tower geometry for its sustainable design. Hot regions, appropriate for solar facilities, and humid regions require larger and more expensive towers. Areas with high solar availability also show larger consumption of water presenting a tradeoff for a future renewable based power system. In addition, design guidelines and surrogate models to estimate water consumption, cooling tower size and its cost as a function of the climate have also been developed. The surrogates are useful for the analysis on the water footprint of a renewable based power system that substitutes the fossil based one.},

  abstract = {This work describes and analyses the Rankine cycle of the 50 MW parabolic trough power plant Andasol 1 in the Spanish region of Andalusia, a prime example of the use of solar energy for electricity generation. By means of an exergoeconomic analysis, all components of the thermal plant are considered individually. Thermodynamic inefficiencies within the system are located, quantified and economically evaluated. Generally, various wet and dry cooling methods come into consideration for the re-cooling of the steam. Andasol 1 uses the more effective wet cooling method, because in the vicinity sufficient water reserves are available. In this work, the water-cooled system is replaced by an air-cooled condenser and the two variants are compared under exergoeconomics aspects. Also the impact of a construction of Andasol 1 in a hotter and drier climate than the northern Sahara is simulated. The analysis shows that within the air-cooled condenser much more exergy is destroyed than within the wet cooling system. Thereby the achievable condenser pressure is one of the critical process parameters. The electricity production cost in the zone around the Andalucian Granada are 15.27 ct/kWh when using wet cooling and 16.08 ct/kWh in case of dry cooling. In the Sahara, these costs increase to 15.52 ct/kWh for wet cooling and 17.52 ct/kWh for dry cooling technology.}

However, local search algorithms are more efficient with computational resources, and therefore numerous random restarts with a local algorithm may be more effective than a global algorithm. This study uses Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the efficiency of a local search algorithm relative to nine stochastic global algorithms when using a neural network on function approximation problems. The computational requirements of the global algorithms are several times higher than the local algorithm and there is little gain in using the global algorithms to train neural networks. Since the global algorithms only marginally outperform the local algorithm in obtaining a lower local minimum and they require more computational resources, the results in this study indicate that with respect to the specific algorithms and function approximation problems studied, there is little evidence to show that a global algorithm should be used over a more traditional local optimization routine for training neural networks. Further, neural networks should not be estimated from a single set of starting values whether a global or local optimization method is used.},

The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions are designed to promote the creation, processing, and sharing of climate and forecasting data using Network Common Data Form (netCDF) files and libraries. The CF conventions provide a description of the physical meaning of data and of their spatial and temporal properties, but they depend on the netCDF file encoding which can currently only be fully understood and interpreted by someone familiar with the rules and relationships specified in the conventions documentation. To aid in development of CF-compliant software and to capture with a minimal set of elements all of the information contained in the CF conventions, we propose a formal data model for CF which is independent of netCDF and describes all possible CF-compliant data. Because such data will often be analysed and visualised using software based on other data models, we compare our CF data model with the ISO~19123 coverage model, the Open Geospatial Consortium CF netCDF standard, and the Unidata Common Data Model. To demonstrate that this CF data model can in fact be implemented, we present cf-python, a Python software library that conforms to the model and can manipulate any CF-compliant dataset.},

  abstract = {Most geothermal and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power plants are dry cooling due to the lack of water sources. Unfortunately, the performance of dry cooling is particularly reduced when the ambient air is hot, which is because dry cooling relies mainly on convective heat transfer to reject heat from the working fluid rather than water evaporation as is in wet cooling systems. This is even worse for natural draft cooling towers as their air flow is created by means of buoyancy effects due to the difference in air density between the inside and outside of the towers. The heat rejection capacity of natural draft dry cooling towers is significantly reduced at high ambient temperatures because the driving buoyancy force is small, resulting in small air flow through the cooling towers. To offset the low performance of dry cooling, pre-cooled cooling systems which combine dry and wet cooling are proposed. The wet cooling system only operates at high ambient temperatures to assist dry cooling. This paper is to investigate the variations in annual performance of three proposed natural draft cooling towers, i.e., a Natural Draft Dry Cooling Tower (NDDCT), a pre-cooled NDDCT and a Natural Draft Wet Cooling Tower (NDWCT). The water consumption of the pre-cooled NDDCT is compared with that of the NDWCT. The present study finds that: the performances of the NDDCT, the pre-cooled NDDCT and the NDWCT are significantly affected by the ambient conditions in operation; the NDWCT provides the highest heat rejection rate, followed by the pre-cooled NDDCT and the NDDCT; the pre-cooling enhancement can go up to 46\% by increasing the NDDCT heat rejection rate from 93\,MW to 136\,MW in the hottest month. The use of the pre-cooling system is season-dependent (usually for hot summers); the pre-cooled NDDCT consumes 70\% less water for every MW heat rejection than the NDWCT.},

In order to gather data for training and testing the proposed ANN model, an experimental counter flow cooling tower was operated at steady state conditions while varying the dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of the air entering the tower and the temperature of the incoming hot water along with the flow rates of the air and water streams. Utilizing some of the experimental data for training, an ANN model based on a standard back propagation algorithm was developed. The model was used for predicting various performance parameters of the system, namely the heat rejection rate at the tower, the rate of water evaporated into the air stream, the temperature of the outgoing water stream and the dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of the outgoing air stream. The performances of the ANN predictions were tested using experimental data not employed in the training process. The predictions usually agreed well with the experimental values with correlation coefficients in the range of 0.975–0.994, mean relative errors in the range of 0.89–4.64\% and very low root mean square errors. Furthermore, the ANN yielded agreeable results when it was used for predicting the system performance outside the range of the experiments. The results show that the ANN approach can be applied successfully and can provide high accuracy and reliability for predicting the performance of cooling towers.},

  abstract = {pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in a solution, which is a function of temperature. Under normal seawater conditions, it is well constrained. Nowadays, with an increasing interest in complex environments (e.g., sea ice), a better understanding of the temperature change on pH under extreme conditions is needed. The objective of this paper was to investigate the temperature coefficient of the seawater pH (∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T}) over a wide range of temperature, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and salinity by a method of continuous pH measurement with the temperature change, and to verify the application of CO2SYS for pH conversion under extreme conditions (on the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) scale and the total proton scale). Both experimental results and CO2SYS calculations showed that ∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T} was slightly affected by temperature over the range of 0°C to 40°C and by pH (at 25°C) from 7.8 to 8.5. However, when pH was out of this range, ∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T} varied greatly with pH value. According to the experimental results, changes in DIC from 1 mmol/kg to 5 mmol/kg and salinity from 20 to 105 had no significant effect on ∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T}. CO2SYS calculations showed a slight increase in ∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T} with DIC on both the NBS scale and the total proton scale; and underestimated ∆pH/∆\mkbibemph{T} at high salinity (i.e., beyond the oceanographic range) on the NBS scale. Nevertheless, CO2SYS is still suitable for pH conversion even under extreme conditions by simply setting the input values of DIC and salinity in CO2SYS within the oceanographic range (e.g., DIC=2 mmol/kg and \mkbibemph{S}=35).},

A thermodynamic model of a 660\,MW thermal power plant with HCS is established, and the variations in thermodynamic characteristics with respect to dry bulb temperature (TA) and relative humidity (RH) are investigated using Ebsilon calculating code. Through comparison between the dry cooling system (DCS) and wet cooling system (WCS), HCS performance characteristics under different meteorological parameters are analyzed quantitatively. By comprehensively considering water and energy conservation indicators, the unique operation mode and ratio of the heat load shared by dry or wet sections are determined under various meteorological parameters. When TA exceeds a certain value or RH falls below a certain value, the HCS does not operate in a hybrid cooling mode. Instead, its operation is equivalent to that of a WCS. We suggest that the cooling load of the wet section in the HCS be designed with the peak cooling load of the condenser under the most inhospitable meteorological parameters of the year. The findings reported here may provide guidance for HCS thermodynamic design and operation regulations.},

  abstract = {A hybrid cooling system consisting of both a dry section and wet section is proposed in this paper as a means to conserving energy and water by combining the benefits of both dry and wet cooling modes. A new thermodynamic coupling characteristics computing model was established to identify the best combination of dry and wet cooling subsystems in the hybrid tower throughout year-round operation based on its air thermodynamic state under the “no plume” principle. A hybrid cooling tower in Inner Mongolia, China, consisting of an elliptical tube heat exchanger with rectangular fins and counter-flow wet packing, was designed as an example under the no plume principle. The minimum number of heat exchanger units in service and the corresponding thermodynamic operating parameters were obtained under a year-round operation. The tower exhibited notable advantages in regards to water conservation compared to the traditional evaporative cooling tower at an estimated yearly savings of 3.74~×~107~kg water.},

There are pressing demands to develop methods to accurately estimate cloud motion that directly affects the stability of solar power output.We propose a solar prediction system that can detect cloud movements from the TSI (total sky imager) images, and then estimate the future cloud position over solar panels and subsequent solar irradiance fluctuations incurred by cloud transients. The experiment studies show that our proposed approach significantly improves the quality of cloud motion estimation within a time window (up to a few minutes) that is sufficient for grid operators to take actions to mitigate the solar power volatility.},

  abstract = {In this work, a universal integrated framework to assess the sustainability of desalination technologies was developed. The framework integrates the techno-economic, environmental and social factors of sustainability using a combination of multi-criteria decision analysis techniques, such as the analytic hierarchy process, swing and weighted summation methods. The framework was based on selected sub-factors assigned to each sustainability factor. While these sub-factors were measured quantitatively or qualitatively, they were all subjected to normalization. A group of global desalination experts were engaged in this study, through a survey used to determine the relative importance of the sustainability factors and the sub-factors. To demonstrate the framework, it was applied to the three dominant desalination technologies in the UAE; MSF, MED, and SWRO. The results showed that SWRO is the most sustainable technology followed by MED then MSF. Changing the sub-factors normalization techniques didn't show an impact on this overall conclusion. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted where the weights of both factors and sub-factors were altered, to study their impact on the overall sustainability ranking. Although this framework was demonstrated via the assessment of sustainability of desalination technologies in the UAE, it can be universally applied to other desalination technologies and/or other countries.},

In this study, we evaluate the potential of final-effect evaporative cooling and internal heat recovery in a multi-effect diffusion distillation (MEDD) to produce pure water without negatively impacting the energy efficiency of the waste-heat source. Lab-scale experimental results from a multi-effect membrane distillation module validate the concept, showing that water production can be enhanced by {$>$}20~\% while simultaneously pulling down the module's operating temperature. A detailed numerical model of a solar-MEDD is implemented and validated. The incorporation of sensible heat recovery and evaporative cooling increase pure water production by approximately 10~\% each. Although the pure water production of a standalone MEDD increases with increasing effects N, when coupled to a solar PV module, increasing N also decreases PV electricity production. Therefore, a PV-MEDD with fewer effects (≤4) is preferable and such a system can produce sufficient water for electrolysis (green H2 production) while maintaining or improving PV electrical energy production throughout the year under varying climatic conditions.},

In this method, process trends are extracted from the measured raw data via wavelet-based multi-scale processing. The process status is then measured using an index with value ranging from 0 to 1 according to the wavelet transform modulus of the extracted process signal. Finally, a steady state is identified if the computed index is small (close to zero). The determination of a characteristic scale for performing steady-state detection was also studied. Compared with the existing approaches for steady-state detection, this method has better precision for detecting changes in process due to the good localization property of wavelet transform, and is more suitable for on-line applications. In this paper, the method is described in detail, and has then been applied to the crude oil unit of a refinery, and to the recausticizing plant of a chemical pulp mill.},

Using the process data with noises discarded and abnormal sudden changes treated effectively, the COD quality prediction can be sure of safety and high accuracy. Next, for some COD units on-line quality analyzers are available, and a new correcting strategy is taken in this paper to give effective update. The update is accomplished based on process data trends extraction. At last, the data processing and the on-line update strategy are introduced to a prediction system of COD product qualities to improve its prediction accuracy.

Conventional approaches relying on rainfall and river runoff in water scarce areas are no longer sufficient to meet human demands. Unconventional water resources, such as desalinated water, are expected to play a key role in narrowing the water demand-supply gap. Our synthesis of desalination data suggests that there are 15,906 operational desalination plants producing around 95\,million\,m3/day of desalinated water for human use, of which 48\% is produced in the Middle East and North Africa region. A major challenge associated with desalination technologies is the production of a typically hypersaline concentrate (termed ‘brine’) discharge that requires disposal, which is both costly and associated with negative environmental impacts. Our estimates reveal brine production to be around 142\,million\,m3/day, approximately 50\% greater than previous quantifications. Brine production in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar accounts for 55\% of the total global share. Improved brine management strategies are required to limit the negative environmental impacts and reduce the economic cost of disposal, thereby stimulating further developments in desalination facilities to safeguard water supplies for current and future generations.},

In line with this fact, multi-objective optimization of a solar-assisted hybrid desalination plant, which encompasses multi-effect distillation with thermal vapor compression and humidification-dehumidification units, was carried out during this study. Parabolic trough solar collectors play the role of a supplier of required input energy to run this system. In addition, there is a heating and storage unit, which includes a latent heat thermal storage tank to store the excess heat gained by solar collectors and an auxiliary boiler to assist in supplying the required heat for desalination units. Design parameters such as Parabolic trough solar collectors rows, phase change materials, number of multi-effect distillation system effects, motive steam flow rate, and last effect brine temperature of multi-effect distillation system which have the greatest impact on the performance of the system are selected. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was employed to conduct multi-objective optimization. According to the optimization results, the total cost rate of the system and the sustainability index is 0.548 \$/s and 1.54 respectively. In addition, adding the humidification-dehumidification unit to the system contribute to producing 0.5\% more fresh water and brings 0.1\% extra cost.},

Solar energy, which is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, can be converted into electricity by using photovoltaic power generation systems. Whether the photovoltaic power generation systems are connected to an electrical grid or not, predicting near-future global solar radiation is useful to balance electricity supply and demand. In this work, two methodologies utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict global horizontal irradiance in 1 to 5 minutes in advance from sky images are proposed. These methodologies do not require cloud detection techniques. Sky photo image data have been used to detect the clouds in the existing techniques, while color information at limited number of sampling points in the images are used in the proposed methodologies. The proposed methodologies are able to capture the trends of fluctuating solar irradiance with minor discrepancies. The minimum root mean square errors of 143 W/m2, which are comparable with the existing prediction techniques, are achieved for both of the methodologies. At the same time, the proposed methodologies require much less image data to be handled compared to the existing techniques.},

  abstract = {In this work we address the problem of solving multiscenario optimization models that are deterministic equivalents of two-stage stochastic programs. We present a heuristic approximation strategy where we reduce the number of scenarios and obtain an approximation of the original multiscenario optimization problem. In this strategy, a subset of the given set of scenarios is selected based on a proposed criterion, and probabilities are assigned to the occurrence of scenarios in the reduced set. The original stochastic programming model is converted into a deterministic equivalent using the reduced set of scenarios. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is proposed for the reduced scenario selection. We apply this practical heuristic strategy to four numerical examples and show that reformulating and solving the stochastic program with the reduced set of scenarios yields an objective value close to the optimum of the original multiscenario problem.},

  abstract = {A global transition to sustainable energy systems is underway, evident in the increasing proportion of renewables like solar and wind, which accounted for 12~\% of global power generation in 2022. The shift to a low-carbon economy will likely require a substantial increase in energy storage in the near future. In this context, concentrating solar power (CSP) is viewed as a promising renewable energy source in the coming decades. However, high generation costs compared to other renewable technologies remain a key barrier inhibiting wider deployment of CSP. Compared to solar PV and onshore wind alternatives, CSP cannot currently compete on the levelized cost of electricity (LCoE). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the vital economic factors and considerations for large-scale CSP expansion. The current state of the market reveals about 8~GW of installed global CSP capacity in 2023, with rapid growth occurring in China, Chile, South Africa and the Middle East. Key economic parameters discussed in this study include capital costs, capacity factors, operating expenses and LCoE. Installation costs for CSP declined by 50~\% over the past decade, falling to the current range of \$3000–11000 per kW. Adding 6–15~h of thermal energy storage at \$20–60 per kW is now considered economical. Capacity factors increased from 30~\% to more than 50~\% (depending on location) through larger storage capacities and higher operating temperatures. Operations and maintenance costs now range from \$12–15 per kW-year. The resulting global weighted average LCoE for CSP plunged 68~\% from \$0.31 per kWh in 2010 to \$0.10 per kWh in 2022. Ongoing innovations in materials, components integrated systems and optimization can further reduce capital expenditures, enhance performance and decrease LCoE. However, appropriate incentives and financing mechanisms remain vital to support continued CSP technology maturation and cost reductions. With its inherent dispatchability and storage capabilities, CSP can become a cost-competitive renewable energy source, but design optimizations and accurate economic appraisals are imperative for CSP to achieve its vast sustainability potential.},

The analysis of the deposits is a crucial step towards the development of suitable technologies for scaling mitigation and prevention. Such analysis, however, is challenging and often requires advanced instrumentation and sample preparation. To overcome this problem, we present a straightforward analytical approach based on Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the chemical analysis of inorganic deposits. For example, it can identify the common anions in scales such as sulfates and carbonates. It can even distinguish between salts with the same anion but different cations such as calcium and sodium. Test measurements are performed on the deposits from a domestic water cooker and from the evaporator of a seawater desalination pilot plant.},

  abstract = {In order to derive higher value operational knowledge from raw process measurements, advanced techniques and methodologies need to be exploited. In this paper a methodology for online steady-state detection in continuous processes is presented. It is based on a wavelet multiscale decomposition of the temporal signal of a measured process variable, which simultaneously allows for two important pre-processing tasks: filtering-out the high frequency noise via soft-thresholding and correcting abnormalities by analyzing the maximums of wavelet transform modulus. Wavelet features involved in the pre-processing task are simultaneously exploited in analyzing a process trend of measured variable. The near steady state starting and ending points are identified by using the first and the second order of wavelet transform. Simultaneously a low filter with a probability density function is employed to approximate the duration of a near stationary condition. The method provides an improvement in the quality of steady-state data sets, which will directly improve the outcomes of data reconciliation and manufacturing costs. A comparison with other steady-state detection methods on an example of case study indicates that the proposed methodology is efficient in detecting steady-state and suitable for online implementation.},

The different methods differ on the choice of the controlled variables, the need for detailed process models, type of measurements used, convergence speed, accuracy, ease of implementation etc. This paper aims to provide a survey of these different approaches under the unified umbrella of feedback optimizing control, and provides an overview and comparison of the different feedback-based real-time optimization approaches for continuous processes.},

  abstract = {Scale formation on heat transfer surfaces is one of the most severe problems in multiple-effect distillers for seawater desalination. A horizontal tube falling film evaporator in pilot-plant scale was used to study crystallization fouling under conditions close to those prevailing in industrial multiple-effect distillers. Experiments were performed with artificial seawater and model solutions based on artificial seawater under various process conditions. In experiments with artificial seawater, the surface of copper–nickel 90/10 tubes was covered with a two-layer scale comprising a thin, flaky magnesium-rich and calcium-free base layer underneath a thick layer of calcium carbonate crystals in the form of aragonite. Analyses indicated Mg(OH)2 (brucite) and iowaite in the thin base layer. The magnesium-rich scale layer was formed even at a low evaporation temperature of 50°C, which promotes the assumption of locally high pH values at the metal-solution interface. A shift of pH to high values in the thin seawater film due to CO2 release and, additionally, cathodic reactions may promote a high degree of supersaturation of Mg(OH)2. Once the tube surface is completely covered with the thin Mg-rich scale layer, it seems that the growth of the Mg-rich layer ceases and aragonite crystals start to precipitate. A decrease in the Mg2+ ion concentration in the solution results in an increase in the mass of calcium carbonate as aragonite in the scale layer. Results suggest that Mg2+ ions retard the calcium carbonate crystallization.},

Heat and mass transfer are the primary causes of entropy production in these systems. The energy efficiency of desalination is shown to be maximized when entropy generation is minimized. Equipartitioning of entropy generation is considered and applied. The mechanisms of entropy generation are characterized, including the identification of major causes of irreversibility. Methods to limit discarded exergy are also identified. Prospects and technology development needs for further improvement are mentioned briefly.},

  abstract = {To meet the Paris Agreement targets, carbon emissions from the energy system must be eliminated by mid-century, implying vast investment and systemic change challenges ahead. In an article in WIREs Climate Change, we reviewed the empirical evidence for effects of carbon pricing systems on technological change towards full decarbonisation, finding weak or no effects. In response, van den Bergh and Savin (2021) criticised our review in an article in this journal, claiming that it is “unfair”, incomplete and flawed in various ways. Here, we respond to this critique by elaborating on the conceptual roots of our argumentation based on the importance of short-term emission reductions and longer-term technological change, and by expanding the review. This verifies our original findings: existing carbon pricing schemes have sometimes reduced emissions, mainly through switching to lower-carbon fossil fuels and efficiency increases, and have triggered weak innovation increases. There is no evidence that carbon pricing systems have triggered zero-carbon investments, and scarce but consistent evidence that they have not. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting and improving climate policy assessment metrics beyond short-term emissions by also assessing the quality of emission reductions and the progress of underlying technological change.},

  abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the few scalable technologies capable of delivering dispatchable renewable power. Therefore, many expect it to shoulder a significant share of system balancing in a renewable electricity future powered by cheap, intermittent PV and wind power: the IEA, for example, projects 73 GW CSP by 2030 and several hundred GW by 2050\>in its Net-Zero by 2050 pathway. In this paper, we assess how fast CSP can be expected to scale up and how long time it would take to get new, high-efficiency CSP technologies to market, based on observed trends and historical patterns. We find that to meaningfully contribute to net-zero pathways the CSP sector needs to reach and exceed the maximum historical annual growth rate of 30\%/year last seen between 2010-2014 and maintain it for at least two decades. Any CSP deployment in the 2020s will rely mostly on mature existing technologies, namely parabolic trough and molten-salt towers, but likely with adapted business models such as hybrid CSP-PV stations, combining the advantages of higher-cost dispatchable and low-cost intermittent power. New third-generation CSP designs are unlikely to play a role in markets during the 2020s, as they are still at or before the pilot stage and, judging from past pilot-to-market cycles for CSP, they will likely not be ready for market deployment before 2030. CSP can contribute to low-cost zero-emission energy systems by 2050, but to make that happen, at the scale foreseen in current energy models, ambitious technology-specific policy support is necessary, as soon as possible and in several countries.},

  abstract = {The growing global demand for fresh water coupled to the increasing interest in renewable energies and waste heat recovery has resulted in flourishing attention to the multi-effect distillation process for seawater desalination. The low operating temperature makes this technology attractive in the case of low temperature heat sources such as geothermal, solar or waste heat recovery. The low energy density of these heat sources requires small-scale desalination systems whose layout and operation may differ from large-scale plant. In this work, new plant configurations for a small-scale multi-effect distillation system are proposed and analyzed from a thermodynamic and economic point of view. Each configuration tends to better exploit the energy content of the various streams by improving heat recovery, according to an increasing layout complexity. These configurations were studied in two layouts, differing in the way seawater and brine fed the various effect. The feed mass flow in each effect was varied to maximize the recovery ratio by imposing the maximum salt concentration in the brine related to calcium sulphate precipitation. Numerical simulations were conducted in Aspen Plus environment by varying the top brine temperature with a fixed bottom brine temperature of 40~°C. The electrolyte non-random two liquid equation of state was adopted to evaluate saltwater properties and an inter-model comparison with a validated algebraic model was carried out. The configurations implementing seawater preheating increased the performance ratio up to 10\% due to the better exploitation of the energy content of distillate streams. The proposed solutions with the maximization of the recovery ratio demonstrated to be cost-effective with respect to the base multi-effect distillation configuration when thermal energy cost became relevant. In the case of negligible thermal energy cost (waste heat recovery) the base configuration was the preferable solution in terms of water cost, despite the lower performance ratio.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to investigate the competitiveness of dry cooling of steam power blocks of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in comparison to wet cooling in the arid zone of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). A case study is performed for this purpose in the Ma’an area in southern Jordan. In Ma’an water is scarce, expensive and restricted. Thus dry cooling of a power block is an attractive option. For the study purposes, a reference parabolic trough CSP power plant that is based on design of Andasol power plant in southern Spain is considered. The reference power plant has a nominal capacity of 50MWel with 7.5 full load storage hours and is simulated with Greenius software (DLR, 2001) for both dry and wet cooling options. The reference power plant is simulated in its original location in order to validate the results using actual values of the plant. Thereafter, simulations were conducted for the power plant at the case study site with the help of high precision ground measured meteorological data provided by the DLR’s enerMENA meteorological (DLR, 2012) station installed on site. The technical simulation at the selected site predicted good economic results thanks to the site’s high direct normal irradiation (DNI) values and normal ambient temperatures (around 5628h 10–30°C). Although dry cooling increases cost versus wet cooling, dry cooled CSP plants still a competitive option in hot arid regions with excellent solar resource such as Ma’an and can even realize lower cost than equivalent wet-cooled plants located in regions with lower solar resource. In this context, from the technical and economical point of view, the dry cooling option in Ma’an showed to be feasible. The reference power plant produces at the selected site in Jordan with dry cooling option 180.54GWhe net annual energy yield, with 4108 full load operating hours. 13.1\% annual mean overall efficiency, with a water consumption of 59,991m3/a, and 0.1444€/kWh the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Whereas, the wet cooled reference power plant produces 201.06GWhe net annual energy yield, with 4399 full load operating hours. 14.6\% annual mean overall efficiency, water consumption of 751,618m3/a, and 0.1258€/kWh LCOE. By comparing the wet cooled reference Andasol power plant in Spain with the same but dry cooled power plant in Jordan, following outputs are resulted: the overall efficiency of the dry cooled plant in Ma’an is reduced by 3.1\%, the water consumption reduced by 92\%. The energy yield increased by 21.8\%, and the LCOE reduced by 18.8\%. The results of this study prove that dry cooled CSP power plants in sites with significantly high DNI values is an attractive economic and technical option to be considered in future planning of new projects.},

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

Based on the heat transfer performance of a cooling tower, this paper proposed a heat transfer model for cooling towers. To verify the accuracy of the model and to demonstrate the applicability of off-design conditions, an experimental system for evaluating the air/water heat transfer performance of cooling towers was established. The experimental results showed that the proposed model for cooling towers had an ability of high-accuracy prediction and adaptability to off-design conditions. Based on the proposed model for cooling towers, the mathematical model of cooling water system online optimization is established. The hybrid programming particle swarm optimization (HP–PSO) algorithm to optimize the operation of cooling water systems was proposed to solve the online optimization problem of continuous variables and discrete variables in cooling water systems. The advantages of the HP-PSO algorithm were verified by the simulation of a small data center. The simulation results showed that the proposed online optimization method of cooling water systems can reduce energy consumption by 15.3\% comparing with other method. This paper can provide an important reference for the operation optimization of cooling water systems in practical engineering.},

While the operation of both depends on the weather, CSP plants operation is also characterized by non steady production of energy that also depends on weather conditions. Furthermore, a CHEMCAD simulation is also put together to evaluate the limits in power production as a result of the cooling capabilities in different climates. The mathematical formulation shows that the driving force is limited in winter and that the extreme temperatures of summer reduce the production capacity of the plant due to limitations in the heat transfer capacity. Colder climates require larger towers but show lower water consumption. Hotter climates need additional heat transfer area. It comes a point when the efficiency of the Rankine cycle and, as a result, the power production must decrease by increasing the exhaust pressure of the low pressure turbine so as to be able to refrigerate the system.},

For a maximum of 25~MW in summer and a minimum of 9.5~MW in winter the annual production cost of electricity is 0.15 €/kWh consuming an average of 2.1~Lwater/kWh. The investment for the plant is 260 M€. Scale-up studies reveal that the production cost can decrease by half while the investment per unit of power should become competitive with current coal based power plants if solar and coal facilities present similar production capacities.},

  abstract = {This work presents the optimization of the operation of a concentrated solar power plant with dry cooling over a year, evaluating the molten salts storage, the power block and the air cooling system as a function of the climate and atmospheric conditions. We locate the plant in the south of Europe, Almería (Spain), due to the high solar irradiation and for comparison purposes with a wet cooling based facility. The optimization of the system is formulated as a multiperiod MINLP (mixed integer non-linear programming problem) that is solved for the optimal production of electricity over a year defining the main operating variables of the thermal cycles and the cooling system. The power produced ranges from 9.5~MW in winter to 25~MW in summer, where 5\% of this power is consumed by the air cooling system. The annual production cost of electricity is 0.16~€/kWh and the investment required is 265~M€, both slightly higher than when wet cooling is used, but with negligible water consumption. For the selected location, the wet based technology generates slightly less CO2 than the air cooled facility.},

  abstract = {Determining the optimization scope is a major issue whenever implementing Real-time Optimization (RTO). Ideally, the optimization problem should encompass the whole plant and not a single unit, which represents only a local subset of the problem. However, if the standard RTO method, the two-step approach (TS), is applied to the entire plant, the whole system needs to be at steady-state (SS) in order to initiate the optimization cycle. This condition is rarely found in practice. One alternative is to apply Real-time Optimization with Persistent Parameter Adaptation (ROPA). ROPA is an RTO variant that integrates online estimators to the standard TS framework and avoids the need of waiting for steady-state to trigger the optimization cycle. However, the problem shifts to obtaining a dynamic model of the entire plant, which can be challenging and time consuming. This paper proposes a variant of ROPA, named asynchronous ROPA (asROPA), where the plant-wide model is partitioned into submodels and, depending on their characteristics, their parameters are updated using either online or steady-state estimators. Consequently, it is not necessary to obtain a dynamic model for the whole process. This asynchronous updating strategy allows the plant-wide model to be up-to-date to the process and the plant-wide optimization can be scheduled at any arbitrary time. The new strategy is applied to a case study consisting of a system whose model can be partitioned into a separation and a reaction submodel. The plant-wide results indicate that asROPA reacts much faster to the disturbances in comparison to the TS approach, improving the overall economic performance and is able to drive the system to the plant-wide optimum. Additionally, a strategy for partitioning the process and choosing the estimation strategy for each partition is proposed.},

  abstract = {Desalination brine has high salinity and contains various chemical contaminants and its disposal causes a major concern for desalination around the world. Environmentally friendly and economically feasible methods are essential for sustainable management of desalination brines. On the other hand, adequate supply of various minerals is essential in meeting the increasing demands of growing populations across the world. Land-based mining industries suffer from limited supply of water and energy, depletion of high-grade minerals, environmental issues and various geopolitical conflicts. Although suffers from high cost, low recovery efficiencies and absence of mature technologies, seawater mining offers a potential solution for this. Seawater contains large quantities of various minerals, of which some are rare and expensive in their land-based forms. This can mitigate the mineral scarcity to some extent and reduce the desalinated water price significantly as we get an additional product from desalination. In addition, the environmental impacts associated with the brine discharge can be avoided as well. This paper reviews recent research and technologies on recovering resources from desalination brine. Major thermal and membrane technologies for recovering water, minerals and energy are included. Recent developments in solar ponds, membrane distillation, membrane distillation crystallization, electrodialysis and reverse electrodialysis, chemical precipitation, adsorption/desorption, eutectic freeze crystallization, pressure retarded osmosis and microbial desalination cell etc. are discussed. Although extraction of several materials from desalination brine is technically possible, it is currently expensive and largely restricts the commercialization. Last decade has witnessed an increased academic interest on this topic, however, the number of pilot-scale research has been very limited.},

We argue that reverse osmosis is significantly more energy efficient and that forward osmosis research efforts would best be fully oriented towards alternate applications. The underlying reason for the inefficiency of forward osmosis is the draw-dilution step, which increases the theoretical and actual energy requirements for draw regeneration. As a consequence, for a forward osmosis technology to compete with reverse osmosis, the regeneration process must be significantly more efficient than reverse osmosis. However, even considering the optimisation of the draw solution and the benefits of reduced fouling during regeneration, the efficiency of an optimal draw regeneration process and of reverse osmosis are unlikely to differ significantly, meaning the energy efficiency of direct desalination with reverse osmosis is likely to be superior.},

  abstract = {This research introduces a novel approach specifically designed to improve the design of Concentrated Solar Power plants utilizing the Response Surface Methodology. The objective of the suggested methodology is to enhance energy production efficiency by simultaneously minimizing the levelized cost of electricity and the land footprint associated with the power plant while comparing three different cooling techniques: air, water, and hybrid. Two software tools, System Advisor Model and Design-Expert, are employed to validate the primary model, evaluate the responses, generate the predictive models, and verify the results. The configuration of a Concentrated Solar Power plant is influenced by four main factors: the size of the solar field (solar multiple), row spacing, number of solar assemblies per loop, and size of thermal energy storage. In this study, these factors are varied within the following ranges: solar multiple from 1 to 5, row spacing from 10 to 30~m, number of solar assemblies from 4 to 10 per loop, and thermal energy storage from 5 to 15~h. The generated predictive models demonstrated very high accuracy, particularly for the annual energy production, with an error ranging between 0.2\% and 1.5\%. The findings showed that the hybrid cooling system is the most cost-effective cooling technique and has the highest energy output compared to the evaporative and air-cooling methods. When optimizing the required area of the hybrid cooled plant with a reduction of 47.44\%, the analysis indicated a minimal decrease in energy output of 3.61\% and a slight increase in the levelized cost of electricity by 0.95\%. According to the results, the effect of area on the annual energy production and levelized cost of electricity is significant below the optimal area, while this effect becomes minor at higher values.},

  abstract = {A treatment chain including nanofiltration, crystallization and multi-effect distillation (MED) is for the first time proposed for the treatment of an effluent produced during the regeneration of Ion Exchange resins employed for water softening. The goal is to recover the minerals and to restore the regenerant solution to be reused in the next regeneration cycle. MED is the most crucial unit of the treatment chain from an economic point of view. A techno-economic analysis on the MED unit was performed and a novel performance indicator, named Levelized Brine Cost, was introduced as a measure of the economic feasibility of the process. Different scenarios were analysed, assuming different thermal energy sources and configurations (plane-MED or MED-TVC). It was found that the plane-MED fed by waste-heat at 1\,bar is very competitive, leading to a reduction of 50\% of the fresh regenerant current cost. Moreover, the thermal energy cost of 20US\$/MWhth was identified as the threshold value below which producing regenerant solution in the MED is economically more advantageous than buying a fresh one. Overall, MED allows reducing the environmental impact of the industrial process and it results competitive with the state of the art for a wide range of operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Second Law efficiency is a useful parameter for characterizing the energy requirements of a system in relation to the limits of performance prescribed by the Laws of Thermodynamics. However, since energy costs typically represent less than 50\% of the overall cost of product for many large-scale plants (and, in particular, for desalination plants), it is useful to have a parameter that can characterize both energetic and economic effects. In this paper, an economics-based Second Law efficiency is defined by analogy to the exergetic Second Law efficiency and is applied to several desalination systems. It is defined as the ratio of the minimum cost of producing a product divided by the actual cost of production. The minimum cost of producing the product is equal to the cost of the primary source of energy times the minimum amount of energy required, as governed by the Second Law. The analogy is used to show that thermodynamic irreversibilities can be assigned costs and compared directly to non-energetic costs, such as capital expenses, labor and other operating costs. The economics-based Second Law efficiency identifies costly sources of irreversibility and places these irreversibilities in context with the overall system costs. These principles are illustrated through three case studies. First, a simple analysis of multistage flash and multiple effect distillation systems is performed using available data. Second, a complete energetic and economic model of a reverse osmosis plant is developed to show how economic costs are influenced by energetics. Third, a complete energetic and economic model of a solar powered direct contact membrane distillation system is developed to illustrate the true costs associated with so-called free energy sources.},

  abstract = {Proper evaluation of the Gibbs free energy and other properties  of seawater and other aqueous solutions is essential in  the analysis of desalination systems. Standard seawater has  been studied extensively and property data are readily accessible.  However, many aqueous solutions requiring desalination have  significantly different composition from seawater and seawater  data is generally not accurate for these solutions. Experimental  data for a given aqueous solution may be unavailable under the  conditions of interest. Therefore, there is a need to model relevant  physical properties from chemical thermodynamic principles. In  particular, for solutions that are not ideal, the activity and fugacity  coefficients must be considered. In this paper, the effect of  nonidealities in sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions is considered  through a parametric study of the least work of separation for a  desalination system. This study is used to determine the conditions  under which the ideal solution approximation is valid and  also to determine when an NaCl solution is a good approximation  to standard seawater. It is found that the ideal solution approximation  is reasonable within ranges of salinities and recovery  ratios typical of those found in the seawater desalination industry  because many of the nonidealities cancel out, but not because  the solution behaves ideally. Additionally, it is found that NaCl  solutions closely approximate natural seawater only at salinities  typically found in seawater and not for salinities found in typical  brackish waters.},

  abstract = {Increasing global demand for fresh water is driving the development and implementation of a wide variety of seawater desalination technologies. Entropy generation analysis, and specifically, Second Law efficiency, is an important tool for illustrating the influence of irreversibilities within a system on the required energy input. When defining Second Law efficiency, the useful exergy output of the system must be properly defined. For desalination systems, this is the minimum least work of separation required to extract a unit of water from a feed stream of a given salinity. In order to evaluate the Second Law efficiency, entropy generation mechanisms present in a wide range of desalination processes are analyzed. In particular, entropy generated in the run down to equilibrium of discharge streams must be considered. Physical models are applied to estimate the magnitude of entropy generation by component and individual processes. These formulations are applied to calculate the total entropy generation in several desalination systems including multiple effect distillation, multistage flash, membrane distillation, mechanical vapor compression, reverse osmosis, and humidification-dehumidification. Within each technology, the relative importance of each source of entropy generation is discussed in order to determine which should be the target of entropy generation minimization. As given here, the correct application of Second Law efficiency shows which systems operate closest to the reversible limit and helps to indicate which systems have the greatest potential for improvement.},

  abstract = {Increasing global demand for fresh water is driving the development and implementation of a wide variety of seawater desalination technologies driven by different combinations of heat, work, and chemical energy. This paper develops a consistent basis for comparing the energy consumption of such technologies using Second Law efficiency. The Second Law efficiency for a chemical separation process is defined in terms of the useful exergy output, which is the minimum least work of separation required to extract a unit of product from a feed stream of a given composition. For a desalination process, this is the minimum least work of separation for producing one kilogram of product water from feed of a given salinity. While definitions in terms of work and heat input have been proposed before, this work generalizes the Second Law efficiency to allow for systems that operate on a combination of energy inputs, including fuel. The generalized equation is then evaluated through a parametric study considering work input, heat inputs at various temperatures, and various chemical fuel inputs. Further, since most modern, large-scale desalination plants operate in cogeneration schemes, a methodology for correctly evaluating Second Law efficiency for the desalination plant based on primary energy inputs is demonstrated. It is shown that, from a strictly energetic point of view and based on currently available technology, cogeneration using electricity to power a reverse osmosis system is energetically superior to thermal systems such as multiple effect distillation and multistage flash distillation, despite the very low grade heat input normally applied in those systems.},

  abstract = {Increasing global demand for fresh water is driving research and development of advanced desalination technologies. As a result, a detailed model of multiple effect distillation (MED) is developed that is flexible, simple to implement, and suitable for use in optimization of water and power cogeneration systems. The MED system is modeled in a modular method in which each of the subcomponents is modeled individually and then instantiated as necessary in order to piece together the complete plant model. Modular development allows for studying various MED configurations (such as forward feed, parallel feed, etc.) with minimal code duplication. Use of equation-oriented solvers, such as Engineering Equation Solver and JACOBIAN, rather than sequential solvers, simplifies the coding complexity dramatically and also reduces the number of required approximations and assumptions. The developed model is compared with four prominent forward feed MED models from literature. Through parametric analysis, it is found that the present model compares very well with the simple model provided by El-Sayed and Silver while providing substantially more detail in regard to the various temperature profiles within the MED system. Further, the model is easier to implement than the detailed El-Dessouky model while relying on fewer assumptions. The increased detail of the model allows for proper sensitivities to key variables related to input, operating, and design conditions necessary for use in a cogeneration or hybrid system optimization process.},

  abstract = {The utilization of seawater for drinking purposes is limited by the high specific energy consumption (SEC) (kW-h/m3) of present desalination technologies; both thermal and membrane-based. This is in turn exasperated by high water production costs, adding up to the water scarcity around the globe. Most technologies are already working near their thermodynamic limit, while posing challenges in further SEC reductions. Understanding the current energy status and energy breakdowns of leading desalination technologies will further help in realizing limitations and boundaries imposed while working for improved system performances. This paper comprehensively reviews the energy requirements and potential research areas for reduced SEC of various thermal, membrane-based and emerging desalination technologies. For thermal desalination processes, which consume a large chunk of energy for heating, renewable energy sources can be a viable option for bringing down the energy requirements. Hence, this review also focuses on the potential of desalination-renewable energy integrations. The review extends beyond conventional energy reduction possibilities to utilizing novel, advanced membranes and innovative techniques for energy offsets. The future of desalination for optimized energy requirements is projected to include ultra-high permeability membranes, fouling resistant membranes, hybrid systems, and renewable-energy driven desalination.},

This paper addresses the comparative evaluation of two different theories based on physical equations (Poppe and Merkel) and three correlations, including a novel and unreferenced one, to predict the performance and water consumption of a wet cooling tower for heat rejection in Concentrated Solar Power plants. Sixteen sets of experiments were conducted in a fully instrumented pilot plant of combined cooling systems to assess the thermal performance of the cooling tower. Key findings indicate accurate prediction of cooling tower outlet water temperature by both Poppe and Merkel theories, as well as the three correlations, with minimal differences, less than 0.94 °C (2.78\%), corresponding to values of R2 = 0.9918 and RMSE = 0.4650. When considering all key variables for CSP performance, the three correlations under comparison exhibited comparable prediction accuracy. This study recommends the combination of the Poppe theory with the correlation ṁw and ṁa, which accounts for air and water mass flow rates independently. This combination demonstrated reasonable accuracy in predicting the outlet water temperature and the water consumption, with average differences of 0.14 °C and 0.01 kg s−1, respectively. These differences correspond to percentage variations of 0.91\% and 9.21\% for the previously mentioned variables. This study provides valuable insights for the modelling and analysis of combined cooling systems integrated in CSP plants, advancing beyond previous efforts in the literature.},

Analytical models were used to optimize parameters and minimize water production costs. Parameters varied were: the ratio of seawater to RO brine in the ED diluate channel, ED current density, ED diluate outlet salinity, electricity and salt prices, and RO recovery by adding high pressure RO (HPRO). Using only RO brine instead of only seawater in the ED diluate channel reduced water production costs by 87\% from 27 to 3.5\,\$/m3 while increasing salt production costs 26\% from 135 to 170\,\$/tonne-salt. The former was best for brine minimization, and the latter for salt production. Optimizing ED current density reduced REC costs by another 14\% to 3.0\,\$/m3 while increasing specific energy consumption 26\% to 12.7\,kWhe/m3, corresponding to a Second Law efficiency of 18\%. Adding an HPRO stage was uneconomical as it increased specific costs 21\%. A salt price of 104.5\,\$/tonne-salt will justify the cost of adding an ED-crystallizer. REC systems may be economically feasible in parts of the Middle-East. Producing other products such as Mg(OH)2 or Br2 may further improve economics.},

  abstract = {In a previous paper, the authors have given correlations for seawater thermophysical properties as functions of temperature and salinity, but only for near atmospheric pressures. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems operate routinely at pressures of 6MPa or more; however, experimental data for seawater properties at elevated pressures (P=0.1–12MPa) are limited to a salinity of 56g/kg. To accurately model and design SWRO and thermal desalination systems, a reliable method of estimating the effect of pressure on seawater properties is required. In this work, we present this method and new correlations for seawater thermophysical properties that are valid within the range: t=0–120°C, S=0–120g/kg, and P=0–12MPa. Seawater isothermal compressibility data, available until a salinity of 56g/kg, were used to develop a correlation for compressibility that is extrapolated to 160g/kg. Thermodynamic identities were then used to develop accurate pressure dependent correlations for seawater: density, isobaric expansivity, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy. New correlations were proposed for seawater: vapor pressure, thermal conductivity and activity of water. Recent work on seawater surface tension and osmotic coefficient were reviewed. Uncertainty bounds were calculated for each correlation.},

  abstract = {The impacts incurred by floods regularly affect the planet's population, inflicting social and economic problems. Optimal control strategies based on reservoir management may aid in controlling floods and mitigating the resulting damage. To this end, an accurate dynamic representation of water systems is needed. In practice, flood control strategies rely on hydrological forecasting models obtained from conceptual or data-driven methods. Encouraged by recent works, this research proposes a novel surrogate model for water flow in a river channel based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach achieved promising results regarding the assimilation of real-data measurements and parameter identification of differential equations that govern the underlying dynamics. This work investigates PINN performance in a simulated environment built directly from a configuration of the Saint-Venant equations. The objective is to create a suitable model with high prediction accuracy and scientifically consistent behavior for use in real-time applications. The experiments revealed promising results for hydrological modeling and presented alternatives to solve the main challenges found in conventional methods while assisting in synthesizing real-world representations. Impact Statement—The research seeks to contribute to the hydrological modeling area with a surrogate model based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks to water flow in a watershed. In practice, these models use conceptual or data-driven methods. Conceptual models to reach the precision provided by the methodology use large numbers of physical parameters. These parameters can demand deep knowledge about the environment and are possibly hard to identify in a complex basin. On the other hand, while data-driven methods do not require such knowledge about the dynamic system, they depend on a reliable and useful database to guarantee the accuracy of system behavior. We introduce PINNs as a viable solution for training neural networks with a few training data and estimating the PDE parameters that govern the underlying dynamics. In addition, we present a novel strategy for training PINNs inspired by Bayesian inference for parameter estimation problems. The research aims to bring forward opportunities to the nontrivial task of hydrological modeling and tools for balancing learning from both physics and data. Consequently, to develop concepts for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {For combined-cycle power plants, the two most dominant steam condenser cooling options are the wet-cooling tower and the air-cooled (dry) systems. The wet cooling system is commonly installed on plants located in areas with available water sources, while the dry system is typically preferred in areas where water is scarce. However, owing to the increasing regulations on water conservation, water usage costs and improvements on cooling system designs, a new approach is required for the optimal selection of plant cooling systems, incorporating site climatic conditions, amongst other considerations. This study presents a comparative techno-economic analysis of a steam turbine cycle with wet- and dry- cooling systems for five typical tropical locations in Nigeria with different climatic conditions and water usage costs. The results show that in the hot (ambient temperatures {$>$}33~°C) and dry regions (relative humidity {$<$}65\%) namely Sahel, Sudan, and Guinea savannah, the plant with wet cooling generated more net power outputs with lower life-cycle costs, operating and maintenance costs than with dry cooling. Thus, for these three regions, the wet cooling system is the best option. But for the Tropical Rainforest and Coastal zones with low ambient temperatures (≤31~°C) and high relative humidity values (≥76\%), the performance and cost implications of the plant with dry cooling was more favourable due to lower system sizes and costs requirements. Parametric investigations revealed that high ambient temperature increased the size and costs requirements of air-cooled systems while relative humidity significantly influenced the total power consumption of water-cooled systems.},

The formulation is based on an adaptive Smith predictor structure plus the addition of a filter acting on the error between the output and its prediction in order to improve robustness. The implementation of the control law is straightforward, and the filter needs no adjustment, since it is directly related to the plant dead-time. An application to an experimentally validated nonlinear model of a solar plant shows that this controller can improve the performance of classical PID controllers without the need of complex calculations.},

  abstract = {This work aims to propose a more robust and realistic dynamic optimization (DO) approach to maximize the profit of distilled water production in a multi-effect desalination (MED) plant integrated with thermosolar storage system. Unlike the literature, the underlying model comprehends the integrated system composed of solar collectors, thermal energy storage (TES) tanks and MED. To carry out this study, a non-linear phenomenological model representative of these conjugated systems was developed and validated with dynamic data from the literature, with maximum relative deviations below 5\%. A sensitivity analysis identified irradiance, ambient temperature, and the water flow to the solar collectors and to the first MED’s evaporator as the main variables. These last two variables were used as decision variables in the optimization problem, which was solved using the orthogonal collocations on finite elements. This method proved to be stable and computationally efficient, with a simulation time of 54~s. The results demonstrate that the consideration of two decision variables, instead of just one in the objective function, provides a 5\% gain in profitability and almost 24\% in distillate production. Simulations over longer time horizon (48~h) confirm that the TES can supply the heat demand for desalination even after sunset, yet a receding horizon architecture is required to prevent tank’s drying or overflow. The optimal profiles obtained for the water flow to the solar collectors and to the MED’s first effect can be used for implementing control schemes.},

Exergy of a system consists of two parts: thermo-mechanical exergy and chemical exergy.

In particular, the theoretical and conceptual developments related to chemical exergy are not covered in any detail. The focus of this article is the chemical exergy of materials. Special attention is given to the theoretical treatment of non-ideal gas mixtures and liquid solutions. The equations necessary to estimate the chemical exergy of ideal and non-ideal mixtures and solutions are developed from the fundamental concepts. Where necessary, numerical examples are given to illustrate the concepts for the benefit of the students. Finally, a practical problem dealing with the furnace/boiler unit of a practical steam power plant is solved using the concepts of chemical exergy and exergy analysis. As the material presented in this article involves advanced level concepts in thermodynamics, it is most suitable for the second, advanced level, course in engineering thermodynamics in third year, after the students have completed a full one-term course on introductory thermodynamics in their second year.},

It undertakes a technological and economic evaluation of the integration of Multi-effect Distillation Plants into CSP plants based on Parabolic Trough solar collectors (PT-CSP+MED), as compared to independent water and power production through Reverse Osmosis unit connection to a CSP plant (CSP+RO). Through this compare and contrast method of analysis, the author establishes guidelines to assist readers in identifying cases wherein PT-CSP+MED systems provide greater benefits from a thermodynamic and economic point of view. The text outlines efficiencies and challenges derived from the combination of PT-CSP power generation with four different desalination plant scenarios, beginning with a description of the equations used in the modeling and validation of a pilot MED plant and followed by detailed thermodynamic analysis of several currently operating CSP+D systems. Comparative thermodynamic assessments are based on a sensitivity analysis from which the overall efficiency of the cogeneration system is determined. The author outlines all the equations used for the modeling of each component and includes 97 comparative tables obtained from the sensitivity analysis, showing the variation of the overall thermal efficiency of the CSP+D as a function of fundamental parameters of the cogeneration cycle, such as the specific electric consumption of the desalination plants, and the turbine outlet temperature of the power cycle. These findings are then placed in practical context through a complete thermo-economic analysis, which is carried out for two specific locations in the Middle East and Europe in order to identify the most practically and economically viable CSP+D system in each region as informed by actual operating conditions, meteorological data and real cost figures for each location.},

Two cases are considered where a low temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED) plant is integrated into a CSP plant replacing the condenser of the power cycle. In one case, a LT-MED plant is fed by steam at the outlet of the turbine expanded to 70~°C. In the other case a LT-MED is fed by the steam obtained from a thermal vapour compressor (TVC) which uses the exhaust steam of the CSP plant (at 37~°C, 0.063~bar) together with some from the high pressure turbine extraction (17~bar). The two cases are compared with that of a reverse osmosis (RO) unit powered by the electricity produced by the CSP plant. In this case, two different wet cooling technologies, once-through and evaporative water cooling, and a dry air cooling are considered for the CSP plant.

Hybrid cooling systems are presented as a potential solution to achieve water consumption reduction since they also avoid a high penalty of efficiency loss in the power block. In this work, a hybrid cooling pilot plant installed at Plataforma Solar de Almería is evaluated experimentally. The system has been tested under different ambient and operating conditions to analyze their influence on the water and electricity consumption. The results reveal that significant water savings were achieved in comparison with the conventional only-wet configuration. Concretely, a maximum water consumption saving of 67\% was found at high ambient temperatures (between 25 and 30~°C) and for a thermal load of 80\% when a hybrid configuration was used. The optimal operating strategies that achieve a tradeoff between low water and electricity consumption have been identified by two efficiency indexes: the specific electricity and water consumption. The parallel configuration was the optimal one in most of the cases. At high ambient temperatures and 80\% thermal load, the electricity and water consumptions of this configuration were 0.033 kWe/kWth and 0.071~L/kWth, respectively.},

In order to run the model, a series of parametric equations have been determined for the following variables: the overall heat transfer coefficient for the first effect (Uh), the overall heat transfer coefficient for the preheaters (Up(i)), the vapor temperature inside the first effect (Tv(1)), and the cooling seawater outlet temperature (Tcwout). They have been obtained from a three-level factorial experimental design (3), performing a total of 81 experiments (3). The results obtained showed a good fit to the estimated models for the response variables.},

  abstract = {Brine from desalination plants is an upcoming environmental threat to aquatic ecosystems. Multi-effect distillation with thermal vapor compression (MED-TVC) is proposed to treat desalination brine solutions of more than 70 000 mg/L of total dissolved solids (TDS). To achieve this, an integrated techno-economic model consisting of three submodels (scaling prediction, mathematical, and economic) is developed and a techno-economic assessment of a 10 m3/d MED-TVC system is presented under two different scenarios. In this respect, various sensitivity analyses were performed, revealing that the 4-effect MED-TVC system operating at 120°C feed steam presents the lowest freshwater cost (US\$3.00/m3) and the lowest payback period (3.04 years) under the first scenario, whereas the 2-effect MED-TVC system operating at 120°C feed steam presents the lowest freshwater cost (US\$1.69/m3) and the lowest payback period (1.71 years) under the second scenario of waste heat utilization. Exergy analysis for these optimal systems revealed that the exergy efficiency of the optimal system in the second scenario (4.36\%) is higher than in the first scenario (4.21\%). For both optimal systems, the exergy destruction in the TVC unit and in the effects accounts for more than 79\% of the total exergy destruction. Moreover, it was found that thermal energy costs contribute significantly to the costs and affect the design procedure. Scaling up the optimal systems for freshwater production by more than 190 m3/d, freshwater cost becomes constant and can be reduced by up to 50\% with waste heat integration. Considering the high quality of the freshwater produced, MED-TVC process can be profitable due to the revenue from the sale of the freshwater. Overall, the results suggest that the MED-TVC process for brine treatment is economically feasible.},

  abstract = {Concentrating solar power plants are a clean energy source capable of competitive electricity generation even during night time, as well as the production of carbon-neutral fuels, offering a complementary role alongside photovoltaic plants. In these power plants, thousands of mirrors (heliostats) redirect sunlight onto a receiver, potentially generating temperatures exceeding 1000°C. Practically, such efficient temperatures are never attained. Several unknown, yet operationally crucial parameters, e.g., misalignment in sun-tracking and surface deformations can cause dangerous temperature spikes, necessitating high safety margins. For competitive levelized cost of energy and large-scale deployment, in-situ error measurements are an essential, yet unattained factor. To tackle this, we introduce a differentiable ray tracing machine learning approach that can derive the irradiance distribution of heliostats in a data-driven manner from a small number of calibration images already collected in most solar towers. By applying gradient-based optimization and a learning non-uniform rational B-spline heliostat model, our approach is able to determine sub-millimeter imperfections in a real-world setting and predict heliostat-specific irradiance profiles, exceeding the precision of the state-of-the-art and establishing full automatization. The new optimization pipeline enables concurrent training of physical and data-driven models, representing a pioneering effort in unifying both paradigms for concentrating solar power plants and can be a blueprint for other domains.},

The CIESOL thermal plant, located at the University of Almería (Spain), is proposed as a case study in which all subsystems and valves are considered in a trustworthy simulation environment. Herein, the thermal plant dynamic representation is completed by presenting the absorption chiller modeling, in which three distinct models, namely, a first principle lumped parameters, an AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (ARX), and a Nonlinear ARX (NLARX) models, are validated. Accordingly, by using these models, the hierarchical control based on a hybrid nonlinear predictive controller is formulated. Dwell-time and stress zone are embedded in the operating condition constraints of the hybrid control component of the upper layer to enhance robustness and performance. Moreover, a lower layer based on Proportional–Integral (PI) controllers is also designed to overcome the valve’s nonlinear dynamics and improve disturbance rejection on the regulatory layer. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical structure controls the solar plant around 115~min more in the operating time of the solar-powered absorption chiller, with less usage of fossil fuels sources compared to a conventional operation of the system.},

  abstract = {Solar thermal plants are commonly constituted of different subsystems, such as the solar collector field, accumulation tanks, and gas heaters, to enhance plant performance. Nevertheless, from a process control perspective, the changes in the subsystem's configuration can cause interactions and compromise the controller performance. Therefore, this work proposes a hybrid practical nonlinear predictive control for a solar thermal plant facility, aiming to improve the plant operation performance by considering mixed-logical dynamic models and including the process constraints as linear mixed-integer inequalities in a single control layer. The proposed strategy is compared with the conventional practical nonlinear control with an external decision-maker. Both frameworks are simulated under actual process circumstances using real meteorological data and validated hybrid models of the CIESOL facility (Spain). This paper makes relevant contributions in some aspects. From the control framework perspective, a new formulation of the hybrid control algorithm simplifies the control structure, excluding the decision-maker structure from its task. Moreover, the present study considers variations in load demand, a novel and significant contribution. The results demonstrate that the hybrid nonlinear controller performs better than the conventional approach, with a reference tracking error index approximately 35\% lower in a sunny day scenario.},

  abstract = {Predictive control strategies with implicit feedforward action are known for enhancing solar collector field system performance. Nevertheless, the nature of the systems’ disturbances, such as solar irradiance, is characterized mainly as being stochastic, which compromises the disturbance rejection performance due to the model prediction uncertainties. Therefore, this work proposes a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) based on a chance-constraint (CC) formulation for controlling a real solar thermal plant. The controller is presented as a CC practical nonlinear MPC (CC-PNMPC), and it is implemented in the AQUASOL-II facility located at Plataforma Solar de Almería, Almería, Spain. This work first investigates the solar collector field plant model based on a parameter identification framework and the irradiance model predictions, using three different models for forecasting. After studying the benefits of the CC-PNMPC in distinct simulated scenarios, which presented about 7\% less error out of the output limits than the deterministic strategy, the stochastic controller is implemented in the actual AQUASOL-II facility to validate and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control approach. The results show that the stochastic strategy can straightforwardly account for disturbance uncertainties in the control optimization layer without additional computational cost or mathematical efforts. Furthermore, for the irradiance prediction uncertainties case, simulations demonstrate that the CC-PNMPC systematically reduces the temperature threshold extrapolation compared to the deterministic strategy.},

The fifth model is a version of the two-state model, an applications suite for nowcasting solar irradiance developed by our team. The two-state model connects in an innovative manner an empirical estimator for clear-sky solar irradiance with a statistical predictor for the sunshine number, a binary indicator stating whether the sun shines or not. On the basis of different error metrics, the models’ performances are analyzed from four perspectives: forecast accuracy, forecast precision, data series granularity and variability in data series. The study is conducted with high-quality radiometric data measured at a high frequency of four samples per minute on the Solar Platform of the West University of Timisoara, Romania. No model is ranked as the best, but the peculiarities that cause a model to perform better than others are discussed. By processing information about the atmospheric transmittance, the two-state model proves a slight advance in the forecast accuracy and a notable performance in the forecast precision.},

In the next step, we design intelligent algorithms to estimate the block-wise base height and motion of each cloud layer based on images from multiple TSIs. This information is then applied to stitch images together into larger views, which are then used for solar forecasting. We examine the system’s ability to track clouds under various cloud conditions and investigate different irradiance forecast models at various sites. We confirm that this system can (1) robustly detect clouds and track layers, and (2) extract the significant global and local features for obtaining stable irradiance forecasts with short forecast horizons from the obtained images. Finally, we vet our forecasting system at the 32-megawatt Long Island Solar Farm (LISF).

  abstract = {In order to counter growing shortages in water supply, there has been an increasing adoption of non-conventional sources, such as desalination. As a matter of fact, the marginal costs of water (i.e., production) or, in a different perspective, the potential and limitations of different technologies, make the use of particular types of desalination methods an increasing possibility. The growing use of hybrid systems highlights the acknowledgment of those technologies as accepted opportunities to diversify water sources, and from a different perspective, render desalination solutions more efficient and effective. Thus, the study of cost determinants which confer a dynamic importance to such technologies is paramount and policy relevant. For that purpose, cost structures and cost determinants were standardized in order to provide guidelines, or a basis, for a suitable cost perception. This paper provides relevant insights of desalination projects’ key factors, and to such an extent, this is a significant contribution. In this analysis, the results achieved compare possible energy solutions, mainly targeting renewable prospects, due to their impact on the total cost of produced water. The economic feasibility of different desalination technologies and energy solutions is also assessed, with a significant focus on possible hybrid possibilities and the site-specificity of such projects, due to their importance and impact on future technology trends and their cost variations.},

  abstract = {The advent of the smart grid requires both reliable, cost-effective energy storage solutions and the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate these systems. Thermocline thermal energy storage, where heat is stored over a temperature gradient, is a promising energy storage technology. However, because of the complexities of thermal stratification, accurate, yet simple models are difficult to identify and generally require complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. In this work, a novel, adaptive-grid one-dimensional model for representing thermocline thermal energy storage systems is presented and validated using experimental data. Compared to standard, fixed-grid one-dimensional models, the adaptive-grid model improves accuracy and decreases the required number of state variables and equations by using a high-resolution grid in the region of thermal stratification and larger, variable-volume, isothermal nodes to represent the ends of the tank. Experimental data shows that the adaptive-grid model is more accurate than other one-dimensional models because it minimizes the effect of numerical diffusion and better predicts system behavior when temperature inversion is introduced into the system. The model presented has applicability in both cold and hot thermal energy storage systems and is advantageous over CFD models when many repeated simulations are required, such as in optimization, control, or prediction of long-term performance.},

In addition, there is a misunderstanding by many water treatment vendors on the use of the indexes. This has resulted in confusion by both end-users and vendors. More importantly, these indexes are shown to be inaccurate and ineffective for calcium carbonate scale prediction. This paper will review many of the available indexes, the basis for their calculations, how they compare, and which are effective in cooling water systems.The development of a new index was started over 10 years ago and has been verified in operating systems. Since most cooling water treatment programs now operate at a pH level above 7.5 and as high as 9 +, the index provides a more accurate and practical estimation of calcium carbonate scaling tendencies. Case histories are provided to show a comparison with other indexes, such as the Ryznar and Langelier indexes.},

Whole-process tests were carried out, and the effects of key operating parameters, including motive steam pressure, maximum operating temperature, temperature difference, spray density, non-condensing gas extraction method, and steam ejector flow, on desalination performance were analyzed. Results showed that the device successfully met product water design requirements; total dissolved solids were less than 5mg/L. Water production initially increased as motive steam pressure increased, then stabilized when pressure exceeded 21\% of the design value. Water production reached its maximum when heat transfer temperature difference and spray density ranged from 3°C to 4°C and from 240L/(mh) to 300L/(mh), respectively. Unlike in parallel mode, water production increased by 3.64\% when vacuum pumping was operated in series mode. Water production and gain output ratio increased, and system energy consumption reduced when a thermo-vapor compressor was introduced. The results provide a useful reference for the design of other large-scale seawater desalination systems.},

  abstract = {In Genetic Algorithm, the population size is an important parameter which directly influences the ability to search an optimum solution in the search space. Many researchers have revealed that having a large number of population leads to the accuracy of getting an optimal solution. But having a large population size will not be a good idea in case where the search space is small. Hence, optimal size for population pool has been determined, but the size is kept fixed. Despite the pool size is optimal, the fixed size population leads to time complexity and make the search more complex by increasing the number of generation to converge. So, the population pool size needs to be dynamically varying through the entire GA evolution of new solutions. This paper proposes an adaptive population pool based genetic algorithm, termed as APOGA, in which the population pool size either grown or shrunk at every iteration based on the performance status of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is implemented and the performance is compared with standard genetic algorithm while solving benchmark test function with varying size of solution space. The experimental results show that APOGA outperforms standard GA for all the solution spaces.},

For this propose, an experiment based on statistical five-level four factorial design of experiments method was carried out in the forced draft cooling tower. Based on statistical analysis, packing height, air flow and water flow were high significant effects on cold water temperature, with very low probability values ({$<$} 0.0001). The optimum operating parameters were predicted using RSM, ANN model and confirmed through experiments. The result demonstrated that minimum cold water temperature was optioned from the ANN model compared with RSM.},

The systems are investigated for energy consumption, productivity enhancement, and performance parameters, including production cost, daily water production, and performance coefficient. Comprehensive economic aspects, future challenges, and future progress of the technologies are discussed accordingly to pave researchers' paths for technological innovation. Traditional AD systems can produce specific daily water production of 25 kg per kg of adsorbent. The solar adsorption desalination-cooling (ADC) showed a promising specific cooling power of 112 W/kg along with a COP of 0.45. Furthermore, for a hybrid MEDAD cycle, the gain output ratio (GOR) and performance ratio (PR) is found to be 40\%, along with an augmented water production rate from 60\% to two folds. The AD technology could manage the high salinity feed water with the production of low salinity water with a reasonable cost of US\$0.2/m3.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the development and application of a feedback linearization control strategy for a solar collector field supplying process heat to a multi-effect seawater distillation plant. Since one objective is to use as much as possible the solar resource, control techniques can be used to produce the maximum heat process in the solar field. The main purpose of the controller presented in this paper is to manipulate the water flow rate to maintain an outlet–inlet temperature gradient in the collectors, thereby ensuring continuous process heating, or in other words, continuous production of fresh water in spite of disturbances. The dynamic behaviour of this solar field was approximated by a simplified lumped-parameters nonlinear model based on differential equations, validated with real data and used in the feedback linearization control design. Experimental results in the seawater desalination plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (Spain) show good agreement of the model and real data despite the approximations included. Moreover, by using feedback linearization control it is possible to track a constant gradient temperature reference in the solar field with good results.},

Within this study, we present an integrated simulation tool for a comprehensive simulation of CSP plants including the water and wastewater streams, treatment units, and the cost of treatment. The models are compared to a set of measured water consumption data from a commercial CSP plant. Furthermore, strategies to reduce raw water consumption are identified and then investigated through the detailed simulation of alternative water management plans. The results show that with optimized solutions, raw water consumption can be reduced by 14\% while the cost of electricity remains the same or is even slightly reduced.},

  abstract = {Modeling actual desalination plants is often restricted by unknown parameters and system specifications that can be difficult to obtain or measure in the field. In this study, we propose an operational data recovery methodology to estimate unknown parameters and construct a simulation that accurately reproduces the operation of actual desalination systems. Furthermore, the data recovery methodology enables desalination modeling with a data-driven iterative sampling scheme to find the most plausible operation scenario. The complete models with data recovery are deployed in four case studies of desalination plants in the field: two multi-effect distillation with thermocompression (MDT) and two reverse osmosis with pressure exchange (ROX). The results show excellent agreement with actual plant operation data, reflected by the maximum difference between simulated and collected data of 5.5~\% and 2.5~\% for the two MDT plants as well as 6.4~\% and 9.3~\% for the two ROX plants. Importantly, this study introduced a new theoretical efficiency metric to define optimal operation of a desalination plant. This metric allowed to highlight two plants operating around 20~\% below their theoretically achievable recovery. This efficiency calculation and complete models could help plant managers identify underperforming plants and evaluate potential upgrades.},

At the Doha desalination plant (DRP) in Kuwait, an on-line standardization software program, based on the ASTM method, has been developed to evaluate the performance data of the two RO lines — spiral wound and hollow fine fiber. This paper investigates the performance of the two RO lines using the program developed and comparing the results with the design data as a reference.

Shell and tube heat exchangers are extensively used in industries for utilization of the heat energy generated from different processes. For definite utilization of this energy, the temperatures of the hot and cold fluids passing through the heat exchanger should be monitored and controlled efficiently. A proper model of heat exchanger is required for the purpose of monitoring and control. The objective of the paper is to mathematically model the heat exchanger using system identification methods and experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of two PID controller tuning methods such as Internal Model Control (IMC) and relay auto-tuning for temperature control. The Auto Regressive–Moving-Average model with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) model of the heat exchanger is obtained from the Pseudo Random Binary Signal (PRBS) experiment performed on the heat exchanger system. The outlet temperature of the cold fluid is considered as the controlled variable. Based on the obtained model, PID settings are designed using the two tuning methods, and the closed loop responses such as servo and regulatory are compared experimentally. It is seen from the experimental results that the IMC based controller shows better results than the relay auto tuning method in terms of time integral error (i.e., ISE and ITAE).},

This paper summarizes the testing procedure and validation of a methodology for large size PTC collectors installed in solar thermal power plants. The testing methodology used was the one defined for conventional size solar collectors in quasi-dynamic state modified in the new revised version of international standard ISO 9806 which is referred to in the new standard IEC 62862-3-2 for CSP large-size PTC testing. The results of the optical and thermal efficiency of a large-size PTC are presented and compared to previous assessments of this collector. Hence, this paper validates the testing methodology for large-size PTC established in new standard IEC 62862-3-2, considering cleaning factor, polynomial heat loss model, incidence angle effects and quasi-dynamic conditions.},

  abstract = {The energy transition is one of the main challenges in mitigating the CO2 emissions from the power sector. Solar and wind resources are presented as the two most promising alternatives in the future energy mix. However, the inherent fluctuations of these two resources jeopardize the stability of the grid. To overcome this issue, the combination of intermittent and non-intermittent renewable energies along with different storage technologies is proposed. In this work, the integration of these technologies is evaluated using different future scenarios. Three renewable resources have been analyzed (solar, wind, and biomass) in combination with four different storage systems (battery, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia). This problem has been evaluated from two different perspectives, economic and social (for which a new indicator is developed). Particularly, this methodology is applied to Spain where different provinces have been assessed to implement these integrated facilities. The results show the paramount importance of using storage alternatives to satisfy the demand and to store energy seasonally. In economic terms, an average cost of electricity of about 100–200 €/MWh is expected with a high influence of the ratios of wind and solar in the different locations and the selected storage alternatives. Additionally, the proposed social index indicates the regions where these facilities could be installed to mitigate social inequalities. With this two-pronged approach, an orderly, fair, and efficient planning of the energy transition can be realized to achieve climate sustainability goals.},

  abstract = {Many arid and semi-arid regions of the world face growing freshwater scarcity, requiring increased utilization of seawater desalination to augment the existing freshwater resources. Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most deployed technologies, due to its electrical energy efficiency and comparatively low costs. However, the required energy for desalination processes is often still converted from fossil sources. Given the growing demand for seawater desalination and the energy sector’s parallel decarbonization, the substitution by renewable energy sources (RES) is a critical issue. The volatility, lower availability of renewable energy, and cost for required electrical energy storage (EES) are all obstacles to the decarbonization of large-scale desalination plants and may affect production volume and water production costs negatively. This paper presents a mathematical model to determine a cost-optimal energy conversion and EES mix for the design and operation of large-scale seawater RO desalination plants. The linear program ensures satisfaction of the plant’s energetic demands. Furthermore, the model allows to investigate the general feasibility of integrating RES into large-scale desalination processes, which are examined by means of a case study while employing location-specific weather data. Different types of energy conversion technologies and the effect of EES on operating behavior, greenhouse gas emissions, and water unit costs are investigated. Specifically, the indirect storage of electrical energy via the smart management of a desalination plant’s oversized RO membranes is examined and compared to battery energy storage (BES). Results indicate that RES cannot meet an RO desalination plant’s full and constant electrical load demand without a high BES capacity, which is probably not feasible from a technical and economic point of view. The economic penalty from energy storage costs on one unit of desalinated water ranges from 3.10 \$/m3 up to 5.38 \$/m3. However, operating an oversized RO desalination plant intermittently could reduce the energy-related costs substantially and potentially provide a more appropriate way of adapting to a volatile supply of energy from renewable sources in order to decarbonize the desalination processes. Specific emissions of desalinated water can be reduced from 1.5~kg CO2 eq./m3 when relying mostly on combined cycle gas turbines down to 0.124~kg CO2 eq./m3 by intermittent operation and fully relying on renewable energy sources.},

Innovative thermally conductive polymer composite tubes based on polypropylene or polyphenylene sulfide filled with graphite have been developed. Crystallization fouling on metal surfaces has been extensively studied. However, fouling data for polymer surfaces are very limited. In the current study, a stirred vessel test rig and a horizontal tube falling film test rig were used to compare the fouling propensity of the polymer composite tubes and common stainless steel tubes. Experiments were performed with calcium sulfate solutions and mixed salt solutions containing calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate. The induction periods and the fouling resistances over time were measured. The novel polymer composite tubes showed a lower crystallization fouling propensity compared to the stainless steel tubes. The induction period was longer and the reduction of the overall heat transfer coefficient over time was notably lower compared to the metal tubes.},

  abstract = {Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) offers flexible and decarbonised power generation and is one of the few switchable renewable technologies that can generate renewable power on demand. Today (2018), CSP only contributes 5 TWh to European electricity generation but has the potential to become an important generation asset for decarbonising the electricity sector within Europe as well as globally. This chapter examines how factors and key political decisions lead to different futures and the associated CSP use in Europe in the years up to 2050. In a second step, we characterise the scenarios with the associated system costs and the costs of the support policy. We show that the role of CSP in Europe depends crucially on political decisions and the success or failure of policies outside of renewable energies. In particular, the introduction of CSP depends on the general ambitions for decarbonisation, the level of cross-border trade in electricity from renewable sources and is made possible by the existence of a strong grid connection between the southern and northern European Member States and by future growth in electricity demand. The presence of other baseload technologies, particularly nuclear energy in France, diminishes the role and need for CSP. Assuming a favourable technological development, we find a strong role for CSP in Europe in all modelled scenarios: Contribution of 100 TWh to 300~TWh of electricity to a future European electricity system. The current European CSP fleet would have to be increased by a factor of 20 to 60 over the next 30~years. To achieve this, stable financial support for CSP would be required. Depending on framework conditions and assumptions, the amount of support ranges at the~EU level from € 0.4 to 2 billion per year, which represents only a small proportion of the total support requirement for the energy system transformation. Cooperation between the~Member States could further help reduce these costs.},

  abstract = {Water, energy, and environmental issues are closely related. New water techniques consume energy, and innovative renewable energy techniques using biofuels and biodiesel consume an incredible amount of water. Different desalination techniques that consume different energy levels from different sources are in use today. Some people, environmentalists, decision makers, and even scientists, mainly in nonscientific publications, consider energy consumption in desalination to be too high and are seeking new ways of reducing it, which often involves increasing capital investment. Efforts should be directed at reducing not only energy consumption but also total water cost. A competent grasp of thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer theory, as well as a proper understanding of current desalination processes, is essential for ensuring beneficial improvements in desalination processes. Thermodynamics sets the absolute minimum limit of the work energy required to separate water from a salt solution. Unavoidable irreversibilities augment the actual energy consumption, yet modern desalination techniques have succeeded in considerably narrowing the gap between actual and limiting energy levels. The implication of this smaller gap is that only marginal energy reductions are possible. The current energy consumption of different desalination processes is reviewed in this paper. A comparison with other common energy-consuming ventures leads to some interesting conclusions.},

In order to produce renewable hydrogen, the power is locally generated by wind turbines and wave energy converters and fully used by the electrolyzers. The energy generated at the platform by wind and wave is balanced by regulating the operating point of each electrolysis unit and its connections or disconnections, using an MPC based on a Mixed-Integer-Quadratic-Programming algorithm. This Predictive Control algorithm makes it possible to take into account predictions of available power and power consumption, to improve the balance and reduce the number of connections and disconnections of the devices. Two case studies are carried out on different installations composed of wave and wind energies feeding a set of alkaline electrolyzers. Validation using measured data at the target location of the platforms shows the adequate operation of the proposed EMS.},

Current cooling systems, either wet (water-cooled) or dry (air-cooled), present trade-offs. Wet cooling towers (WCT) optimize performance but raise concerns due to substantial water usage, especially in water-scarce prone locations of CSP plants. Dry cooling conserves water but sacrifices efficiency, specially during high ambient temperatures, coinciding with peak electricity demand. A potential compromise is a combined cooling system, integrating wet and dry methods, offering lower water consumption, improved efficiency and flexibility. Incorporating such systems into CSP plants is of considerable interest, aiming to optimize operations under diverse conditions. This research focuses on the first step towards this goal; developing static models for WCTs. Two approaches, Poppe and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are developed and thoroughly compared in terms of prediction capabilities, experimental and instrumentation requirements, sensitivity analysis, execution time, implementation and scalability. Both approaches have proven to be reliable, with Poppe providing better results, based on MAPE, for the outlet temperature and water consumption (0.87 \% and 3.74 \%, respectively) compared to a cascade-forward ANN model (1.82 \% and 5.21 \%, respectively). However, for the target application, the better execution time favors the use of ANNs.},

Whereas this approach will suffice for the comparison of same energy input processes, omitting the grade of energy when comparing diverse technologies may lead to incorrect conclusions and, resultantly, inefficient installations. Here, a standard primary energy-based thermodynamic framework is presented that addresses the energy efficacy of assorted desalination processes. Example calculations show that a thermal desalination plant integrated with a power plant consumes 2–3\% of input standard primary energy. We also propose a standard universal performance ratio methodology to provide a level playing field for the comparison of desalination processes; this suggest that the majority of desalination processes are operating far from the sustainable zone, with only \textasciitilde 10–13\% at the ideal or thermodynamic limit. A proposed roadmap shows that attaining an efficacy level of up to 25–30\% of the thermodynamic limit is crucial for achieving the 2030 sustainability development goals for seawater desalination, which will require a technological shift in the capability of dissolved salts separation processes.},

  abstract = {Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton cycles are considered to be a potentially viable option for reducing the cost of electricity generation from solar power tower plants, owing to theoretically high efficiency, low compressor work, and compact turbomachinery. These cycles have relatively high heat rejection temperatures ({$>$}70\,°C), which are ideal for integration with multi-effect distillation (MED) for distillate generation from seawater, without being a parasitic load to the power plant as compared to cogeneration with steam Rankine cycle. The intermittency of solar radiation reduces the annual capacity factor of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants to about 50–60\% even with a molten salt storage tank of 10-h. This reduces the annual distillate generation and increases the cost of the distillate. A novel concept to reduce distillate cost is introduced, whereby the waste heat from the sCO2 Brayton cycle is stored. A two-tank demineralized water storage tank is selected and is shown to allow for the integration of a smaller MED system operating at an increased capacity factor. The optimal storage tank design reduces the distillate cost by 19\% and increase the MED capacity factor from 46.4\% to 75\%. Different coastal locations with good solar resource are studied for cogeneration with the CSP-sCO2 Brayton cycle. Techno-economic analysis shows the cost of distillate produced by MED is 16\% cheaper than the distillate produced from reverse osmosis system for Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.},

The use of such an analysis in seawater desalination processes is of growing importance to determine the sites of the highest irreversible losses.

Furthermore, a common model that represents seawater as an ideal mixture of liquid water and solid sodium chloride may have serious shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, the most up-to-date thermodynamic properties of seawater, as needed to conduct an exergy analysis, are given as correlations and tabulated data. The effect of the system properties as well as the environment dead state on the exergy and flow exergy variation is investigated. In addition, an exergy analysis for a large MSF distillation plant is performed using plant operating data and results previously published using the above-mentioned ideal mixture model. It is demonstrated that this ideal mixture model gives flow exergy values that are far from the correct ones. Moreover, the second law efficiency differs by about 80\% for some cases.},

  abstract = {Seawater is a complex electrolyte solution of water and salts with sodium chloride as the major constituent. However, the thermodynamic properties of seawater are considerably different from those of aqueous sodium chloride solution. In the literature, exergy analyses of seawater desalination systems have sometimes modeled seawater by sodium chloride solutions of equivalent salt content or salinity; however, such matching does not bring all important properties of the two solutions into agreement. Furthermore, some published studies attempt to represent sodium chloride solutions as a specific model for an ideal mixture of liquid water and solid sodium chloride, which is shown to have serious shortcomings. In this paper, the most up-to-date thermodynamic properties of seawater are compared with those of aqueous sodium chloride solution as well as the ideal mixture model. The flow exergy is calculated using various models and the results are compared. In addition, the minimum work required to desalinate a unit mass of fresh water from seawater of varying salinity is calculated using these models. The flow exergy calculated using the ideal mixture model in question is about 50\% less than that of seawater. Accordingly, the minimum desalination work is underpredicted by about 50\% when calculating it using that ideal mixture model. This consequently shows that exergy analysis and the second law efficiency calculations performed using the ideal mixture model is comparatively far from the actual values.},

It focuses on utilizing solar energy to yield freshwater from the sea or brackish water with less environmental impacts, for greenhouses, which can produce sustainable food all over the year. The integration of various solar-driven desalinations such as solar still, humidification-dehumidification, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and multieffect and multistage flash with greenhouses are evaluated, for better sustainability towards greenization. The paper first discusses the specifications of solar-driven desalinations and compares their advantages and limitations. Then, different types of greenhouses are introduced, and their total water requirement is discussed based on their locations, crop type, greenhouse technology, irrigation type, and environmental conditions, as well as their cooling and heating strategies. Later, the existing integration of solar-driven desalinations with greenhouses are reviewed, and their advantages and limitations are deliberated. Finally, the paper discusses the criteria to be considered when selecting solar-driven desalinations for greenhouses and presents a detailed comparison between the water production rate and cost as well as the energy consumption of these systems.

  abstract = {The SIMC method for PID controller tuning (Skogestad in J. Process. Control 13:291–309, 2003) has already found widespread industrial usage. This chapter gives an updated overview of the method, mainly from a user’s point of view. The basis for the SIMC method is a first-order plus time delay model, and we present a new effective method to obtain the model from a simple closed-loop experiment. An important advantage of the SIMC rule is that there is a single tuning parameter (τc) that gives a good balance between the PID parameters (Kc,τI,τD) and can be adjusted to get a desired trade-off between performance (“tight” control) and robustness (“smooth” control). Compared to the original paper of Skogestad (J. Process. Control 13:291–309, 2003), the choice of the tuning parameter τcis discussed in more detail, and lower and upper limits are presented for tight and smooth tuning, respectively. Finally, the optimality of the SIMC PI rules is studied by comparing the performance (IAE) versus robustness (Ms) trade-off with the Pareto-optimal curve. The difference is small, which leads to the conclusion that the SIMC rules are close to optimal. The only exception is for pure time delay processes, so we introduce the “improved” SIMC rule to improve the performance for this case.},

  abstract = {The hybridization of desalination processes is one of the most promising technologies to overcome the current limitations of desalination technologies while maximizing the advantages of individual processes in practice. Multi-effect distillation (MED) and adsorption desalination (AD) hybrid desalination process has been investigated in this study to maximize the utilization of energy input in desalination. Two different thermal desalination technologies have been integrated, and the synergetic impact of utilizing energy enhanced the performance of the hybrid system. The synergetic thermodynamic model has been developed in this study and the experimental results from the pilot unit, with a nominal production capacity of 10 m3/day, installed at KAUST, KSA have been affirmed the proposed model. Both the water production and the universal performance ratio (UPR) have been improved 2–5 times in different quality of the heat source (40–60~°C) to the MED. Moreover, the MED-AD hybrid process is enabled to scavenge the energy from the ambient temperature below 30~°C for the desalination. The utilized energy of both thermal and flash evaporation in all operation conditions, and individual effects has been inventoried to analyze the thermodynamic synergy of the hybridization. In the sole MED operations, the energy input in the first effect is carried over to the following effects, and part of it is used for thermal evaporation. However, due to the AD driven flash evaporation, the energy used in evaporation of the following effect is shown greater than the previous effect. The developed synergetic model of MED-AD hybrid system and its experiment with 4-effects MED pilot have demonstrated the potential of the hybrid system and its application to the industrial processes.},

  abstract = {Cooling tower is crucial equipment in the cool-end system of power plant and the natural draft counter-flow wet cooling tower (NDWCT) gets wide application. The artificial neural network (ANN) technique is becoming an effective method for the thermal performance investigation of cooling towers. However, the neural network research on the energy efficiency performance of NDWCTs is not sufficient. In this paper, a novel approach was proposed to predict energy efficiency of various NDWCTs by using Back Propagation (BP) neural network: Firstly, based on 638 sets of field test data within 36 diverse NDWCTs in power plant, a three-layer BP neural network model with structure of 8-14-2 was developed. Then the cooling number and evaporation loss of water of different NDWCTs were predicted adopting the BP model. The results show that the established BP neural network has preferable prediction accuracy for the heat and mass transfer performance of NDWCT with various scales. The predicted cooling number and evaporative loss proportion of the testing cooling towers are in good agreement with experimental values with the mean relative error in the range of 2.11\%–4.45\% and 1.04\%–4.52\%, respectively. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of different NDWCTs can also be predicted by the proposed BP model with consideration of evaporation loss of water in cooling tower. At last, a novel method for energy efficiency prediction of various NDWCTs using the developed ANN model was proposed. The energy efficiency index (EEI) of different NDWCTs can be achieved readily without measuring the temperature as well as velocity of the outlet air.},

The separation process of the desalination technologies by membranes and by distillation is considered as an example for the purpose of clarity and for the special importance to desalination. Both the energetics and the economics of the separation process are based on a quantitative formulation of the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the concept of exergy and its destruction. The separation process is considered for five main desalination systems: reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, vapor compression, boiling evaporation and flash evaporation. The results of the energetic analysis show a close competition between reverse osmosis and distillation for seawater desalination. The electrodialysis process is justified for the treatment of more dilute brackish water. It is shown that the determination of the driving force associated with exergy destruction occupies a central position in this comparison. The optimal design of the separation surface for minimum cost of energy and surface requirements takes off smoothly from the energetic analysis and sets the basis of a general and powerful approach to optimal system design. A second paper [1] is devoted to the general approach and its extension to cover almost all kinds of industrial processes and their combinations to produce one or more products.},

The choice of tube material affects the wettability, the adhesion forces between surface and deposit, and the induction time of crystallization fouling. The effects of surface properties on crystallization fouling from seawater have been investigated in a horizontal tube falling film evaporator in pilot plant scale. Experiments were performed with artificial seawater and various tube materials. The tube surfaces were characterized by measuring surface roughness and contact angles and by determining surface free energies. The tube materials show qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to scale formation. The interfacial defect model was applied to the system. Spreading coefficients of CaCO3 scale on the aluminum alloys 5052 and 6060 and stainless steel grade 1.4565 were calculated to be higher than those on copper–nickel 90/10 and aluminum brass, but the quantities of CaCO3 scale measured on the tube surfaces were much lower compared to CuNi 90/10 and aluminum brass. The application of advanced approaches such as the interfacial defect model depends on the precise knowledge of interfacial free energies, which are very difficult to find. However, results suggest that more similar values of the interfacial free energies of heat transfer surface and deposit lead to increased scale formation.},

  abstract = {Multiple-effect distillation (MED) plants with horizontal tube falling film evaporators for sea water desalination exhibit relatively high heat transfer coefficients achieved by film flow under clean surface conditions. However, they are susceptible to heat transfer deterioration and scale formation accompanied by film breakdown. Thus, maintaining all heated tubes in a fully wetted state is one of the key issues to be considered in designing falling film evaporators. Surface tension, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and wettability of materials play an important role in scale formation. The wetting rate, that is the brine mass flow rate on one tube per unit tube length, is one of the most important parameters in the design and operation of MED plants. It has an impact on heat transfer, tube bundle design, scale formation, the capital and operational costs of the plant and its operational flexibility. Thus, it is very important to acquire a better understanding of the wetting behaviour and the impact of different tube materials, various process parameters and sea water properties on tube wetting. The wetting behaviour of different tube materials such as aluminium brass, copper–nickel 90/10 and aluminium alloy AlMg2.5, which are commonly used in MED plants, was investigated in a horizontal tube falling film evaporator in pilot plant scale. In tests with stepwise increasing and decreasing wetting rate, pictures of the film flow over the horizontal tubes were taken and the percentages of the wet surface area were evaluated by means of an image processing software. The tube surfaces were characterized by measuring contact angles and determining surface free energies. Furthermore, the horizontal tube falling evaporator was used to study the effect of the wetting rate on composition and quantity of mixed salt scale. Experiments were performed with artificial sea water at wetting rates from 0.14 kg/(s m) down to 0.025 kg/(s m) for different tube materials such as aluminium brass, copper–nickel 90/10 and AlMg2.5. New insights into the wetting behaviour of different tube materials and the influence of the wetting rate on scale formation in the horizontal tube falling film evaporators are given. The effects of various process parameters such as wetting rate, temperature and salinity on the wettability of typical tube materials and the effect of the wetting rate on composition and quantity of mixed salt scale are presented and discussed.},

However, the premature convergence of GA has unexpected effect on the algorithm’s performance, the main reason is that the evolution of outstanding individuals multiply rapidly will lead to premature loss of population’s diversity. To solve the above problem, a method to qualify the population diversity and similarity between adjacent generations is proposed. Then, according to the evaluation of population diversity and the fitness of individual, the adaptive adjustment of crossover and mutation probability is realized. The results of several benchmark functions show that the proposed algorithm can search the optimal solution of almost all benchmark functions and effectively maintain the diversity of the population. Compared with the existing algorithms, it has greatly improved the convergence speed and the global optimal solution.},

This paper analyzes and compares the energetics of several desalination technologies at the high salinities and diverse compositions commonly encountered in produced water from shale formations to guide technology selection and to inform further system development. Produced water properties are modeled using Pitzer's equations, and emphasis is placed on how these properties drive differences in system thermodynamics at salinities significantly above the oceanic range. Models of mechanical vapor compression, multi-effect distillation, forward osmosis, humidification–dehumidification, membrane distillation, and a hypothetical high pressure reverse osmosis system show that for a fixed brine salinity, evaporative system energetics tend to be less sensitive to changes in feed salinity. Consequently, second law efficiencies of evaporative systems tend to be higher when treating typical produced waters to near-saturation than when treating seawater. In addition, if realized for high-salinity produced waters, reverse osmosis has the potential to achieve very high efficiencies. The results suggest a different energetic paradigm in comparing membrane and evaporative systems for high salinity wastewater treatment than has been commonly accepted for lower salinity water.},

  abstract = {Thermal energy from concentrating solar thermal technologies (CST) may contribute to decarbonizing applications from heating and cooling, desalination, and power generation to commodities such as aluminium, hydrogen, ammonia or sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). So far, successful commercial-scale CST projects are restricted to solar industrial process heat (SIPH) and concentrating solar power (CSP) generation and, at least for the latter, depend on support from public policies that have been stagnating for years. As they are technologically similar, spillovers between SIPH or CSP and other emerging CST could accelerate commercialization across use cases while maximizing the impact of scarce support. Here, we review the technical potential for cross-fertilization between different CST applications and the ability of the current policy regime to enable this potential. Using working temperature as the key variable, we identify different clusters of current and emerging CST technologies. Low-temperature CST (\&lt;400℃) applications for heating, cooling and desalination already profit from the significant progress made in line-focussing CSP over the last 15 years. A newly emerging cluster of high temperature CST (\&gt;600℃) for solar chemistry and high-grade process heat has significant leverage for spillovers with point-focussing solar tower third-generation CSP currently under development. For these spillovers to happen, however, CSP policy designs would need to prioritize innovation for high working temperature and encourage modular plant design, by adequately remunerating hybridized plants with heat and power in and outputs that include energy sources beyond CST solar fields. This would enable synergies across applications and scales by incentivizing compatibility of modular CST components in multiple sectors and use cases.},

  abstract = {Zero liquid discharge (ZLD)—a wastewater management strategy that eliminates liquid waste and maximizes water usage efficiency — has attracted renewed interest worldwide in recent years. Although implementation of ZLD reduces water pollution and augments water supply, the technology is constrained by high cost and intensive energy consumption. In this critical review, we discuss the drivers, incentives, technologies, and environmental impacts of ZLD. Within this framework, the global applications of ZLD in the United States and emerging economies such as China and India are examined. We highlight the evolution of ZLD from thermal- to membrane-based processes, and analyze the advantages and limitations of existing and emerging ZLD technologies. The potential environmental impacts of ZLD, notably greenhouse gas emission and generation of solid waste, are discussed and the prospects of ZLD technologies and research needs are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Microgrids play a crucial role in transitioning from the current energy grid model to one that seamlessly integrates renewable energy sources. However, the variability and unpredictability inherent in renewable energy pose new challenges in controlling energy flows within the microgrid. To ensure smooth operation in isolated mode or to minimize reliance on polluting energy sources, microgrids need to incorporate energy buffers and accurately predict renewable energy production, considering its intermittent nature. These factors significantly influence the development of effective microgrid controllers. This work presents a hybrid model-based predictive control to manage the energy flows in a microgrid. The proposed approach addresses both the discrete and continuous dynamics of the system through an optimized solution, incorporating, as main contribution, temporary constraints, which allows for integration of electric vehicle operating modes. The controller is tested in simulation with real data from a microgrid located at the CIESOL centre in Almería (Spain). Moreover, a comparison with a rule-based controller and a switching model predictive control is provided. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively decreases the economic costs of microgrid management, outperforming the rule-based controller and the switching model predictive controller by 8.23\% and 1.94\%, respectively, over a thirty-day scenario.},

This control strategy aims to satisfy the load demand of an office located in the CIESOL bioclimatic building, which was placed in the University of Almería, using a quadratic cost function. The simulation scenarios took into account real simulation parameters provided by the microgrid of the building. For case studies of one and five days, the optimization was aimed at minimizing the input energy flows of the microgrid and the difference between the energy generated and demanded by the load, subject to a series of physical constraints for both outputs and inputs. The results of this work show how, with the correct tuning of the control strategy, the energy demand of the building is covered through the optimal management of the available energy sources, reducing the energy consumption of the public grid, regarding a wrong tuning of the controller, by 1 kWh per day for the first scenario and 7 kWh for the last.},

  abstract = {The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) contracted with WorleyParsons Group, Inc. to examine the effect of switching from evaporative cooling to alternative cooling systems on a nominal 100-MW parabolic trough concentrating solar power (CSP) plant. WorleyParsons analyzed 13 different cases spanning three different geographic locations (Daggett, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Alamosa,Colorado) to assess the performance, cost, and water use impacts of switching from wet to dry or hybrid cooling systems. NREL developed matching cases in its Solar Advisor Model (SAM) for each scenario to allow for hourly modeling and provide a comparison to the WorleyParsons results.Our findings indicate that switching from 100\% wet to 100\% dry cooling will result in levelized cost ofelectricity (LCOE) increases of approximately 3\% to 8\% for parabolic trough plants throughout most of the southwestern United States. In cooler, high-altitude areas like Colorado's San Luis Valley, WorleyParsons estimated the increase at only 2.5\%, while SAM predicted a 4.4\% difference. In all cases, the transition to dry cooling will reduce water consumption by over 90\%. Utilitytime-of-delivery (TOD) schedules had similar impacts for wet- and dry-cooled plants, suggesting that TOD schedules have a relatively minor effect on the dry-cooling penalty.}

Optical performance in line-focus collectors is defined by three parameters, peak-optical efficiency and longitudinal and transversal incidence angle modifiers. In parabolic-troughs, the transversal incidence angle modifier is usually assumed equal to 1, and the incidence angle modifier is referred to the longitudinal incidence angle modifier, which is a factor less than or equal to 1 and must be quantified. These measurements are performed by operating the collector at low fluid temperatures for reducing heat losses. Thermal performance is measured during tests at various operating temperatures, which are defined within the working temperature range of the solar field, and for the condition of maximum optical response. Heat losses are measured from both the experiments performed to measure the overall efficiency and the experiments done by operating the collector to ensure that absorber pipes are not exposed to concentrated solar radiation. The set of parameters describing the performance of a parabolic-trough collector of large size has been measured following the test procedures proposed and explained in the article.},

  abstract = {Visual analytics is arguably the most important step in getting acquainted with your data. This is especially the case for time series, as this data type is hard to describe and cannot be fully understood when using for example summary statistics. To realize effective time series visualization, four requirements have to be met; a tool should be (1) interactive, (2) scalable to millions of data points, (3) integrable in conventional data science environments, and (4) highly configurable. We observe that open source Python visualization toolkits empower data scientists in most visual analytics tasks, but lack the combination of scalability and interactivity to realize effective time series visualization. As a means to facilitate these requirements, we created Plotly-Resampler, an open source Python library. Plotly-Resampler is an add-on for Plotly's Python bindings, enhancing line chart scalability on top of an interactive toolkit by aggregating the underlying data depending on the current graph view. Plotly-Resampler is built to be snappy, as the reactivity of a tool qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze data. A benchmark task highlights how our toolkit scales better than alternatives in terms of number of samples and time series. Additionally, Plotly-Resampler's flexible data aggregation functionality paves the path towards researching novel aggregation techniques. Plotly-Resampler's integrability, together with its configurability, convenience, and high scalability, allows to effectively analyze high-frequency data in your day-to-day Python environment.},

Scale formation on the evaporator tubes strongly depends on film flow characteristics. The thickness of the liquid film on a horizontal tube was measured in a test rig with a high-resolution optical micrometer. Furthermore, scale formation was studied with artificial seawater in a horizontal tube falling film evaporator at pilot plant scale. The effects of a polyoxyalkylene triblock copolymer surfactant on falling film flow and scale formation were investigated at different wetting rates. Film thicknesses on the bottom of the tube exceed film thicknesses on the top by an order of magnitude. The thinnest film is formed on the tube sides. The mean film thickness increases with increasing wetting rate. The scale formation on the top of the tube is stronger than that at the bottom. The highest scale thickness was measured at the tube sides. Scale mass and scale layer thickness increase with decreasing wetting rate. As the minimum and the mean film thickness increase and surface waves are mostly damped in presence of the surfactant, the mass transfer resistance is higher and, thus, scale formation is reduced.},

While low water-use heat rejection designs are applicable to any technology that utilizes a Rankine steam cycle for power generation, they are of special interest to concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies that are located in arid regions with limited water availability. System performance is evaluated using hourly simulations over the course of a year at Daggett, CA. The scope of the analysis in this paper is limited to the power block and the heat rejection system, excluding the solar field and thermal storage.

The International Energy Outlook 2016 (IEO2016) predicted that the Non Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) countries will lead with 71\% rise in energy demand in contrast with only 18\% in developed countries from 2012 to 2040. In Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, about 40\% of primary energy is consumed for cogeneration based power and desalination plants. The cogeneration based plants are struggling with unfair primary fuel cost apportionment to electricity and desalination. Also, the desalination processes performance evaluated based on derived energy, providing misleading selection of processes. There is a need of (i) appropriate primary fuel cost appointment method for multi-purposed plants and (ii) desalination processes performance evaluation method based on primary energy. As a solution, we proposed exergetic analysis for primary fuel percentage apportionment to all components in the cycle according to the quality of working fluid utilized. The proposed method showed that the gas turbine was under charged by 40\%, steam turbine was overcharged by 71\% and desalination was overcharged by 350\% by conventional energetic apportionment methods. We also proposed a new and most suitable desalination processes performance evaluation method based on primary energy, called universal performance ratio (UPR). Since UPR is based on primary energy, it can be used to evaluate any kind of desalination processes, thermally driven, pressure driven \& humidification-dehumidification etc. on common platform. We showed that all desalination processes are operating only at 10–13\% of thermodynamic limit (TL) of UPR. For future sustainability, desalination must achieve 25–30\% of TL and it is only possible either by hybridization of different processes or by innovative membrane materials.},

This work numerically models the efficiency of six representative desalination technologies powered by waste heat at 50, 70, 90, and 120 °C, where applicable. Entropy generation and Second Law efficiency analysis are applied for the systems and their components. The technologies considered are thermal desalination by multistage flash (MSF), multiple effect distillation (MED), multistage vacuum membrane distillation (MSVMD), humidification-dehumidification (HDH), and organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) paired with mechanical technologies of reverse osmosis (RO) and mechanical vapor compression (MVC). The most efficient technology was RO, followed by MED. Performances among MSF, MSVMD, and MVC were similar but the relative performance varied with waste heat temperature or system size. Entropy generation in thermal technologies increases at lower waste heat temperatures largely in the feed or brine portions of the various heat exchangers used. This occurs largely because lower temperatures reduce recovery, increasing the relative flow rates of feed and brine. However, HDH (without extractions) had the reverse trend, only being competitive at lower temperatures. For the mechanical technologies, the energy efficiency only varies with temperature because of the significant losses from the ORC.},

  abstract = {Forecasting renewable energy efficiency significantly impacts system management and operation because more precise forecasts mean reduced risk and improved stability and reliability of the network. There are several methods for forecasting and estimating energy production and demand. This paper discusses the significance of artificial neural network (ANN), machine learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in predicting renewable energy and load demand in various time horizons, including ultra-short-term, short-term, medium-term, and long-term. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the methodologies and applications that utilize the latest developments in ANN, ML, and DL for the purpose of forecasting in microgrids, with the aim of providing a systematic analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive database from the Web of Science was selected to gather relevant research studies on the topic. This paper provides a comparison and evaluation of all three techniques for forecasting in microgrids using tables. The techniques mentioned here assist electrical engineers in becoming aware of the drawbacks and advantages of ANN, ML, and DL in both load demand and renewable energy forecasting in microgrids, enabling them to choose the best techniques for establishing a sustainable and resilient microgrid ecosystem.},

  abstract = {In multiple-effect distillers with horizontal tubes, which are increasingly employed in seawater desalination, scale formation on the heat transfer surfaces has a highly deleterious effect on specific energy consumption and production capacity. The allowance for potential scale formation by over-sizing the heat transfer surface, scale prevention methods, cleaning methods as well as production losses during plant shutdown for cleaning create considerable capital, operating, and maintenance costs. It is therefore essential to incorporate a cost-effective scale control technique. In multiple-effect distillers scale is formed on the outside of the tubes. Mechanical cleaning methods cannot be employed. Achieving effective scale control by suitable anti-scalants is a major challenge for the desalination industry. Scale formation and control in multiple-effect distillers with horizontal tubes for seawater desalination have barely been investigated. The effects of the process parameters and of the anti-scalants on the properties of the scale, e.g., the composition, structure, and morphology, are inadequately understood. Clarifying these aspects of scale formation would facilitate further improvement of anti-scalants and thus the efficiency of multiple-effect distillers. In order to study scale formation and control under conditions that are close to those prevailing in industrial multiple-effect distillers, a horizontal tube evaporator at pilot-plant scale was employed. In the test rig the process conditions in any stage and at various operating conditions of multiple-effect distillers can be provided. Thus, the effects of the thermal field, the flow field, the fluid properties, and the substrate properties can be studied. Experiments with artificial seawater were performed at different operating conditions. Novel aspects of the formation and reduction of scales formed from falling seawater films on the outside of horizontal tubes are presented. The effects of various process conditions such as fluid temperature, heat transfer surface temperature, heat flux, and seawater salinity on the composition and structure of scale layers are shown. The beneficial effects of polymeric anti-scalants on the quantity, composition, and morphology of the scale are discussed. For example, the use of only 0.5 ppm of a specific anti-scalant effectuated a very strong reduction of the calcium carbonate content in the scale as well as a notable decline of the magnesium hydroxide content.},

Herein, we report polyvinyl alcohol sponges compounded with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and carbon nanotubes as all-in-one 3D dual-functional solar-thermal evaporators for simultaneous high-flux desalination and electricity generation. The sponge composites possess high solar absorptance, hierarchical porous structure, strong anti-salt fouling capability and negatively-charged ionic channels. In particular, the enlarged 3D evaporation surfaces and the low evaporation enthalpy achieved a high evaporation rate of 6.8~kg~m−2 h−1 and a high evaporation efficiency of 94.9\% under one-sun solar irradiation. The evaporation-induced high-flux directional flow of seawater through the ionic channels within the sponges generate a stable potential of 117.8~mV. By connecting several sponge evaporators in series, we show that the integrated system can stably generate potable freshwater out of seawater under continuous solar irradiation to meet individual drinking need, and simultaneously produce sufficient electricity to power small electronic devices. The stable superior performance, integrated structure design and facile manufacturing process would make the all-in-one 3D sponge evaporators promising for renewable off-grid coproduction of drinkable clean water and electricity.},

A simulation program was built with Visual Basic programming language in order to achieve the objective. Hourly values of solar radiation flux on horizontal surface, ambient temperatures, wind velocities and seawater temperatures which have been measured for ten years (1999 to 2009) used for 18 stations to obtain more reliable and realistic simulation results. A system was designed and the design criteria for all sub-systems were developed to provide the interconnection among them.

For practical application, automatic selection of noise band amplitude is proposed to make the method convenient to be used. Problems of gross errors, low signal-to-noise ratio and online identification are considered. And comparison with other two methods shows that the proposed method has better identification performance.

  abstract = {Parabolic trough concentrating (PTC) solar power generation is the most technologically mature way of concentrating solar power technology. PTC plants are generally located in flat desert areas, with sufficient sunshine but lacking water for condenser cooling. Herein, a novel cooling system, radiative cooling (RC) integrated with a parabolic trough reflector, is proposed for the PTC system, which means that the waste heat generated during power generation can be radiated to the colder universe by the parabolic reflectors instead of being entirely dissipated to ambient air without water evaporation or land occupation. The simulation results demonstrate the potential of the proposed cooling system to serve as an independent cooling system by adjusting the temperature difference between radiator and ambient within −4.1 to 9.3°C, with 100\% water savings and a water pump power consumption rate of 1.8–2.1\%. The capital cost of implementing this new cooling system is estimated to be \$27.4–54.5/kWe. Furthermore, an annual average of 86.1\% of total cooling capacity is dissipated through thermal radiation, with 14.4\% directly sent to the cold universe through the atmosphere window, providing a possible method to solve the water problem of power plants in torrid-arid areas and curb global warming if large-scale applications are used.},

ASTM D 4516 is based on normalized pressure over time for a given set of data, considers temperature only for water production but not for salt passage. The HSDM MTC is diffusion based and the HSDM considers variations in flux and recovery for salt passage. Normalization of the HSDM MTCs for temperature and pressure over time provided a universal assessment for the water and water quality for a specific diffusion controlled membrane. Assessment of water production was identical by either method, but assessment of salt passage was different. Salt passage determined by the ASTM method is dependent on actual net solute driving force, while HSDM determined salt passage is dependent on MTCs, flux, recovery, temperature, net solute driving force and changes in mass transfer over time. The HSDM MTC method of membrane evaluation is more versatile for assessment of membrane performance at varying sites and changing operation.},

  abstract = {Solar thermal desalination is a viable approach for sustainable water production. Current thermal desalination technologies suffer from high specific energy consumption and energy mismatch. Concentrating solar collectors operate with high temperature energy and desalination systems operate with low temperature energy which leads to large exergy destruction. Herein, a thermodynamic model of an ideal concentrating solar-distillation process is developed to evaluate system integration and performance limitations (specific water production). Three different heating architectures are examined to understand how solar collector absorber temperature, concentration ratio, and recovery ratio impact system performance. A reversible solar distillation system operating with a concentration ratio of 10 at the optimal absorber temperature of 507~K can achieve a maximum specific water production of \textasciitilde 166.3 gs−1m−2 as the recovery ratio (rr) approaches zero. An endo-reversible heat engine model was formulated to consider system irreversibilities. Systems with irreversibilities (R~=~0.001~K/kW or 0.005~K/kW) experience a decrease in the water production rate to 8.8~g s−1m−2 (rr~=~51.4\%) and 1.9~g s−1m−2 (rr~=~65.2\%). For efficient integration of solar collectors with thermal desalination systems, it is critical to adopt appropriate heating configurations and control absorber temperatures, system recovery ratio, and system irreversibilities.},
