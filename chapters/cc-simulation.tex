\labch{cc:simulation}

\tldrbox{ This chapter presents an analysis of the annual performance of
    different cooling alternatives applied to a commercial 50~MW$_\text{e}$
    \gls{cspLabel} plant, Andasol-II, located in southern Spain. Three cooling
    systems are compared: the actual cooling system of the plant, a
    \gls{wctLabel} and the proposed combined cooling system (\gls{ccLabel}) with
    two different capacities for the dry cooler, 75\% and 100\% of the nominal
    thermal load of the \gls{wctLabel} system. For each alternative the
    operation is optimized in a water-scarce scenario using the proposed
    multi-stage optimization framework, adapted to the particular case study.\\

    Results show that integrating the \gls{ccLabel} can reduce specific cooling
    costs by up to 80\% and annual water consumption by about 48\%, with 38\%
    savings during the driest months. These benefits arise from reduced dependence
    on costly alternative water sources. The \gls{ccLabel} alternatives also
    provide more stable, cost-effective operation across the year compared to the
    \gls{wctLabel}, which is highly sensitive to water scarcity. Overall, the study
    demonstrates that optimized combined cooling can significantly enhance both
    economic and water-use efficiency in \gls{cspLabel} plants.

A modeling framework has been developed to simulate and optimize the operation
of various cooling systems, with a particular focus on the proposed combined
cooling configuration. After being validated with data from a pilot plant in the
previous chapter, this framework is now applied to a real-world case study: the
commercial 50~MW$_\text{e}$ \fullgls{cspLabel} plant Andasol-II.

To evaluate the performance of different cooling alternatives in terms of water
use and operational costs, an annual simulation of the Andasol-II plant is
conducted. Located in south-eastern Spain near Guadix, at the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada (see \reffig{cc:simulation:andasol}), the site benefits from a
high elevation (1100~m) and a semi-arid climate, resulting in exceptionally high
annual direct insolation (2260~W/m$^2$). These conditions made it an ideal
location for Europe's first parabolic trough plant, Andasol-I, commissioned in
2008, followed by Andasol-II one year later with nearly identical design.

Andasol-II has a rated output of 50~MW and 7.5~hours\sidenote[][*-14]{If fully
charged, the thermal storage system can supply the turbine at nominal power for
this duration} of thermal storage, providing electricity for up to 200,000
people. According to the developer, the plant vaporizes 870,000~m$^3$/year,
corresponding to a specific water consumption of \textbf{5~l/kWh}. Additional
specifications are summarized in \reftab{cc:simulation:andasol}.

\section{Environment definition}
\labsec{cc:simulation:environment}

The environment replicates the definition presented in
\nrefsec{cc:optimization:environment} and visualized in
\reffig{cc:simulation:optimization-environment}, adapted to the specific case
study of Andasol-II. It includes the weather data, thermal load profile, and
prices for electricity and water. The following subsections detail the data
sources and modeling approaches used to define each component of the
environment.

%================================
\subsection{Water context}
\labsec{cc:simulation:environment:water}

Obtaining accurate water availability data is challenging. Unlike resources
such as electricity ---where demand, supply, and prices are readily
available--- water availability data is often lacking. Water prices are not
standardized; they vary from region to region, and even within the same region,
depending on the source and the specific agreements in place.

For the simulation scenario, two sources of water are considered\sidenote{See
\nrefsec{cc:optimization:environment}}. The first source is rainwater
collected in a reservoir, which is assumed to be available at a constant price. To
create a representative dataset, water availability is modeled as a function of
precipitation data, which can be obtained from hourly \gls{tpyLabel}
data~\sidecite{meteotestag_meteonorm_}. A linear model is fitted to relate
maximum precipitation to maximum available water, and when there is no
precipitation, water availability is set to zero. The data is then resampled
every 15 days, and the daily volume of available water is calculated by dividing
the resampled fortnightly volume by 15. This approach accounts for the presence
of water reservoirs and some degree of management capacity.

The alternative regenerated water source\sidenote{This is not an exogenous
idea; the Villena \gls{cspLabel} plant, for example, uses wastewater from a nearby prison
to partially meet its water needs} is not limited in volume.

%================================
\subsection{Thermal load}
\labsec{cc:simulation:environment:load}

% Traditionally, thermal power plants were designed and operated to generate
% electricity only when solar energy was available. This approach remained common
% until the rapid rise in competitiveness of \gls{pvLabel} plants, which offer
% significantly lower generation costs. In response, concentrated solar power
% plants began integrating thermal energy storage systems to enable dispatchable
% power generation. Today, 21 out of 51 \gls{cspLabel} plants in Spain—approximately
% 42\%—have thermal storage capacities exceeding two
% hours~\sidecite{thonig_cspguru_2023,lilliestam_midterm_2021,bonilla_csp_2024}.
% This enables them to produce electricity even when solar input is unavailable.

% Andasol-II follows traditional operating patterns. It generates most of its
% electricity during peak solar hours and the storage is primarily used to extend
% generation past sunset. This strategy is increasingly seen as suboptimal and is
% likely to be phased out as the electric grid becomes saturated with
% \gls{pvLabel} generation\sidenote{This saturation trend is already observable in
% Spain during the summer months}.

%     photovoltaic generation is clearly visible at midday, while thermosolar

%     is majorly from \gls{cspLabel} plants with no storage.\\

% In this work, a different operational strategy is adopted: the plant is
% configured to generate electricity during off-peak solar hours, typically in
% the evening when electricity demand is at its highest. This is achieved by
% shifting the plant's production to align with these peak demand periods.

% A model of the Andasol-II plant, developed by
% Ortega-Delgado~\etal~\sidecite{ortegadelgado_theoretical_2016}, was configured
% to follow this production strategy and simulated over an entire year. The
% resulting thermal load profile represents the demand to be met by the cooling
% system. The simulation used the same weather dataset as that employed for
% modeling the cooling system.

Andasol-II follows a traditional operating pattern: electricity is generated
mainly during peak solar hours, and the thermal storage is used primarily to
extend production shortly past sunset. Although this strategy is increasingly
considered suboptimal in modern electricity markets, it remains the operating
mode of the plant and is therefore the one considered in this study.

To obtain the thermal load profile required for the annual cooling system
simulation, a detailed model of the Andasol-II plant developed by
Ortega-Delgado~\etal~\sidecite{ortegadelgado_theoretical_2016} was configured to
replicate this traditional production strategy and simulated over a full year.
The resulting time series represents the thermal demand that the cooling system
must satisfy.

\textbf{Electricity}. The spanish grid operator \gls{reeLabel} provides an
API~\sidecite{REE_website} to access the electricity market prices. A python
script was developed to systematically download monthly data\sidenote{Longer
periods would result in silent errors in the API} for each month in the desired
year. The data is fetched in hourly intervals and saved in JSON format, then
every file is read and joined into a single dataset resulting in prices for the
whole year. 

\textbf{Water}. Rainwater has a constant lower price of
$P_{w,s1}=0.03$~\euro/m$^3$. This price was obtained considering that the
plant has access to the same water than the irrigation community of the area. The
alternative source, \ie regenerated water, is considerably more expensive, and
its price is linked to the electricity price, specifically by a factor of 80:
$P_{w,s2}=80\times P_{e} = 8\pm 5$~\euro/m$^3$.%\sidenote{This value includes
% a scaling factor}.

\section{Cooling alternatives comparison}[Alternatives comparison]
\labsec{cc:simulation:alternatives-comparison}

\begin{marginfigure}[*-2]

\end{marginfigure}


The results presented in \reffig{cc:simulation:year-specific-analysis} highlight the
potential benefits of integrating the proposed combined cooler into the
Andasol-II power plant, particularly under water-scarcity conditions. The
comparison between the \gls{wctLabel} baseline and the \gls{ccLabel}
alternatives shows a remarkable reduction in the specific cooling cost: the
\gls{ccLabel} achieves reductions of around 80\% compared to the \gls{wctLabel}
reference case.  

This cost improvement is mainly explained by the reduced reliance on the
alternative water source, which dominates the cooling cost in the \gls{wctLabel}
configuration. By introducing the combined cooler, annual water consumption is
reduced by 48\% on average, and by 38\% during the most critical driest and
hottest months (see \reffig{cc:simulation:year-comparison}). This demonstrates
the ability of the \gls{ccLabel} to alleviate water stress without compromising
cooling performance.  

The figure also emphasizes the importance of comparing cooling system
alternatives under representative annual operating conditions and not just
analyzing annual averages. The \gls{wctLabel} option exhibits much higher
sensitivity to water availability, with sustained high associated costs through
most of the year and negligible on periods of water abundance. The \gls{ccLabel}
options (both at 75~\% and 100~\% DC capacity) provide stable and cost-effective
operation across most of the year, only penalized in the most challenging (June
- September) period and to a much lower degree compared to the \gls{wctLabel}.

    \labfig{cc:simulation:year-specific-analysis}
\end{marginfigure}

These findings highlight the necessity of using optimization strategies in
hybrid or combined cooling systems. Such systems rely on a coordinated
allocation of thermal load between dry and wet units, and optimized scheduling
is essential to fully exploit their potential for water and cost savings. The
proposed multi-stage optimization framework demonstrates this capability and can
be readily adapted to other cooling configurations or extended to different
resource availability scenarios and boundary conditions, enabling informed
decision-making for sustainable plant operation.  

One inherent limitation that no optimization strategy can entirely eliminate is
the natural mismatch between cooling needs and water availability: the periods
of highest cooling demand (hot, dry summers) typically coincide with limited
water resources, while cooler months offer both lower demand and higher
availability. Despite this structural constraint, the combined system shows
substantial room for efficiency gains through optimal operation. Furthermore,
\gls{cspLabel} plants may consider adjusting their generation patterns—
especially during extreme summer heat—shifting production away from the hottest
hours, when water scarcity and cooling requirements peak, toward evening
periods, when cooling is more efficient and renewable supply is lower.  

Finally, the results confirm that water is often the dominant cost driver and
thus the most critical limiting factor depending on site conditions and cooling
technology choice. Even under a conservative assumption of an alternative water
source cost of $\approx$0.08~\euro/l, water-driven costs largely determine the
viability of different cooling options. Discussions with the Villena
\gls{cspLabel} plant O\&M team indicate that alternative water can exceed
1~\euro/l in some regions, which would further reinforce the advantages of the
proposed combined cooling system and the need for water-efficient operational
strategies.
