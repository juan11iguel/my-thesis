The author of this research work holds a degree in Industrial Engineering with a
specialization in Electronics and Automation from the University of Almería
(Spain) and a degree in automation by the \textit{Università degli Studi di
Brescia} (Italy). In 2021, he was awarded a scholarship by the CIEMAT research
center to pursue a PhD within the Solar Thermal Applications Unit at the
Plataforma Solar de Almería, where he has conducted his research from 1 February
2021 to 31 January 2025.

Throughout his academic and professional career, he has developed a strong
interest in scientific computing, automation, and control systems. His work has
provided extensive experience with tools and technologies such as Linux, Python,
Docker, LaTeX, and the Robot Operating System (ROS). He is also an advocate of
open science and open-source software, supporting initiatives that promote
transparency and collaborative research.

For his bachelor's thesis, he established a mobile robotics laboratory at the
University of Almería by deploying the Duckietown project. This work provided
practical experience with ROS and containerization technologies through Docker.
His master's thesis focused on the design and implementation of a SCADA-like
monitoring and control system using Python.

During his PhD studies, the author has presented his research at several
international conferences, including the IFAC Conference on Advances in
Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control, the European Desalination Society
(EDS) conferences (2022 and 2023 editions), and the SolarPACES conference (2025
edition). He has also participated in the Doctoral Colloquium program (Sollab),
presenting his work in Spain (2021), Switzerland (2022), and Germany (2023), as
well as in the annual progress meetings of the University of Almería's Doctorate
Program in Computer Science (2021--2025).

Additionally, the author has completed several international research stays: a
short stay at the Cyprus Institute (Nicosia, Cyprus) in 2023; a main research
stay at the \textit{Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina} (Florianópolis,
Brazil) from February to June 2024; and a one-month stay at the \textit{Technische
Universität Chemnitz} (Germany) in 2025.

Also, during his time at \gls{psaLabel} he participated in different dissemination
activities and projects. Being part of the national project \textit{SOLpréndete -
Didactics and dissemination of CSP}, participating since his undergraduate
period in every edition of the European Researchers Night and giving some talks at
high-schools as part of the program \textit{DivulgaCIEMAT}.
