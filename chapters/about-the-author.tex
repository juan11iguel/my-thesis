I am currently completing my PhD thesis, with the defense planned for October.
My research interests lie primarily in automatic control, optimization, and
robotics, especially as applied to solar thermal processes.

I think I am mostly a creative person, but in order to implement those ideas,
throughout my work, I’ve gained experience with a variety of tools and
technologies, including Linux, Python, Docker, LaTeX, and the Robot Operating
System (ROS). I’m particularly passionate about open science and open source
software, and I strive to contribute to communities that value transparency and
collaboration.

For my bachelor's thesis, I created a mobile robotics lab in the University of
Almería by deploying the \href{https://duckietown.com/}{Duckietown project}.
This gave me the opportunity to interact and work with ROS, and since the whole
project was deployed using Docker, to learn about containerization
technologies. For my master's thesis, work was also software-related, but this
time it was about the implementation of a SCADA-like system using Python.
During my PhD, I have had four years to really delve into these technologies,
so today they are an integral part of my workflow and I am confident to say
they've helped me become effective at implementing those (sometimes too) many
ideas\todo{Lidia esto solo lo he copiado por tener algo, ya lo mejoraré}.
