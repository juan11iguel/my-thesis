In order to study the potential advantages of making use of a combined cooling
system, it is first necessary to develop the modelling of its components. Since
the objective is performance prediction, this chapter focuses on the steady
state modelling of the combined cooler main components, \ie the \gls{wctLabel}
and the \gls{dcLabel}. More specifically, the aim is to compare two modelling
strategies: that based on physical equations
(\refsec{intro:modelling:first-principle}) and that based on black box models
(\refsec{intro:modelling:data-driven}) such as \glspl[format=long]{annLabel},
in order to see which one is more suitable for its integration in the
optimization of the complete process. 

This chapter presents a comparison between the two modelling approaches, at
steady state and with a focus on optimization applications, in terms of
predictive capabilities, experimental and instrumentation requirements,
execution time, implementation and scalability. A sensitivity analysis is
performed to further analyze and compare each case study. It also presents and
evaluates all relevant aspects of interest in the development of such models,
specifically for \gls{annLabel}s, model configuration, architecture and topology are
discussed. 

Other system components are also described in
\nrefsec{cc:modelling:other-components} and finally their integration is
discussed in \nrefsec{cc:modelling:complete-model}.

% \subsection{Wet cooling tower modelling}

In the case of the models based on physical equations, the analysis of wet
cooling towers has its origin in~\sidecite{merkel_verdunstungskuhlung_1925}, in
which the theory for their performance evaluation was developed. Merkel
proposed a model based on several assumptions to simplify the heat and mass
transfer equations to a simple hand calculation. However, these assumptions
mean that Merkel's method does not reliably represent the physics of the heat
and mass transfer process in a cooling tower. This was already stated by
Bourillot~\sidecite{bourillot_hypotheses_1983} who concluded that the Merkel
method is simple to use and can correctly predict cold water temperature when
an appropriate value of the coefficient of evaporation is used. However, it is
insufficient for the estimation of the characteristics of the warm air leaving
the fill and for the calculation of changes in the water flow rate due to
evaporation. Jaber and Webb~\sidecite{jaber_design_1989} developed the
equations necessary to apply the effectiveness-NTU\sidenote{The
effectiveness-NTU method estimates how well a heat exchanger transfers heat by
comparing the actual heat transfer to the maximum possible, using a parameter,
\gls{ntuLabel}, that reflects its size and flow characteristics.} method directly to
counterflow or
crossflow cooling towers. This approach is particularly useful in the latter
case and simpler compared to a more conventional numerical procedure. Notice
that the effectiveness-\gls{ntuLabel} method is based on the same simplifying
assumptions as the Merkel method. On the other hand, Poppe and
Rögener~\sidecite{poppe_berechnung_1991} developed the Poppe method. They
derived the governing equations for heat and mass transfer in a wet cooling
tower and did not make any simplifying assumptions as in the Merkel theory,
which makes it a very precise model. As a matter of fact, predictions from the
Poppe formulation have resulted in values of evaporated water flow rate that
are in good agreement with full scale cooling tower test
results~\sidecite{kloppers_critical_2005}. This model has already been used for
the evaluation of the thermal performance of solar power plants using different
condensation systems (wet, dry and hybrid system), as can be found in Cutillas
et al.~\sidecite{cutillas_energetic_2021}. 

In the case of black box models, numerous authors in the literature have
designed \gls{annLabel} models for \gls{wctLabel} with different objectives, such as performance
prediction, simulation and optimization. One of the first works in this area is
the one described in~\sidecite{hosoz_performance_2007} where an \gls{annLabel} model was
developed to predict the performance of a forced-counter flow cooling tower at
lab scale. In this case, the input variables were the dry bulb temperature, the
relative humidity of the air stream entering the tower, the temperature of the
water entering the tower, the air volume flow rate and the cooling water mass
flow rate. The outputs of this model were the heat rejection rate at the tower,
the mass flow rate of water evaporated, the temperature of the cooling water at
the tower outlet, the dry bulb temperature and the relative humidity of the air
at the outlet of the tower. The results obtained with a 5-5-5\sidenote{The
notation $n_1$-...-$n_l$ represents the architecture of the \gls{annLabel} model, where
$l$ is the number of layers and $n_i$ are the nodes in each one of the layers.}
\gls{annLabel} demonstrated that wet cooling towers at lab-scale can be modelled using
\gls{annLabel}s with a high degree of accuracy. There are also \gls{annLabel} models for Natural
Draft Counter-flow Wet Cooling Towers (ND\gls{wctLabel}) at lab-scale, such as the one
proposed by \sidecite{gao_artificial_2013}. In this case, the authors
used a 4-8-6 \gls{annLabel} structure and considered some additional variables, such as
air gravity, wind velocity, heat transfer coefficients and efficiency as
outputs. All these works can be useful to validate the model development
methodology but may fail predicting the performance of \gls{wctLabel} at larger scale. In
this sense, special attention deserves the study carried out by
\sidecite{song_novel_2021} where an 8-14-2 \gls{annLabel} model was proposed
to predict the performance (the cooling number and the evaporative loss
proportion) of ND\gls{wctLabel}s at commercial scale. The model is based on 638 sets of
field experimental data collected from 36 diverse ND\gls{wctLabel}s used in power plants.
It is a very challenging work since it covers samples from a wide range of
tower sizes and capacities being the \gls{mreLabel} below 5~\%. 

From the literature review, it can be stated that there are works based on
Poppe and \gls{annLabel} models that evaluate the main output variables of \gls{wctLabel}s.
Nevertheless, to the author knowledge, there are no studies focused on the
comparison between both modelling strategies. Also lacking is a comprehensive
analysis of the different aspects that affect the models development and
performance.


The static models presented in this section have been developed to predict two
main outputs, the water temperature at the outlet of the \gls{wctLabel}, $T_{w,o}$, and
the water consumed due to evaporation losses, $\dot{m}_{w,lost}$. The inputs
variables required by both modelling approaches, Poppe model and \gls{annLabel} models,
are: the cooling water flow rate ($\dot{m}_w$), the water temperature at the
inlet of the \gls{wctLabel} ($T_{w,i}$), the ambient temperature ($T_{\infty}$), the
ambient relative humidity ($\phi_{\infty}$) and the frequency percentage of the
fan ($f_{fan}$) (or its equivalence in air mass flow rate\sidenote{\gls{annLabel} uses as
input $f_{fan}$ whereas Poppe's model uses $\dot{m}_a$.}, $\dot{m}_a$).

\subsection{Poppe model} 
\labsec{cc:modelling:met_poppe}

The well-known Merkel number is accepted as the performance coefficient of a
wet cooling tower \sidecite{navarro_critical_2022}. This dimensionless number is
defined in \refeq{Me}, and it measures the degree of difficulty of the
mass transfer processes occurring in the exchange area of a wet cooling
tower.

\begin{equation} 
    Me = \frac{h_D a_v V}{\dot{m}_w}, 
    \labeq{Me}
\end{equation}

where $h_D$ is the mass transfer coefficient, $a_V$ is the surface area of
exchange per unit of volume and $V$ is the volume of the transfer region.

The Merkel number can be calculated using the Merkel and Poppe theories for
the performance evaluation of cooling towers. On the one hand, the Merkel
theory \sidecite{merkel_verdunstungskuhlung_1925} relies on several critical assumptions, such as the
Lewis factor (Le) being equal to 1, the air exiting the tower being saturated
with water vapour and it neglects the reduction of water flow rate by
evaporation in the energy balance. On the other hand, the Poppe theory
\sidecite{poppe_berechnung_1991}, which is the one used in this work, do not consider
simplifying assumptions, thus being the one most usually preferred. In this
theory, the authors derived the governing equations for heat and mass
transfer in the transfer region of the wet cooling tower (control volume
shown in \reffig{cc:modelling:poppe-transfer-area}) assuming a one dimensional problem. In
this figure, the red and green dashed lines indicate the fill and air-side
control volumes, respectively.

Following the detailed derivation process and simplification of the
previously-mentioned governing equations described in
\cite{navarro_critical_2022}, the major following equations for the heat and mass
transfer obtained, according to the Poppe theory, are: 

\begin{eqnarray}
    & & 
    \frac{d\omega}{dT_w} = \frac{c_{p_w}
    \frac{\dot{m}_w}{\dot{m}_a}\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega \right)
    }{\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)+\left(\lew-1
    \right)\left[\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)-\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega
    \right)h_v\right] -\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega \right)h_w } \\
    & & 
    \frac{dh}{dT_w} = c_{p_w}\frac{\dot{m}_w}{\dot{m}_a}
    \left[1+\frac{\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega  \right)c_{p_w}
    T_w}{\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)+\left(\lew-1
    \right)\left[\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)-\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega
    \right)h_v\right] -\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega \right)h_w}\right] \\
    & & 
    \frac{d\Me}{dT_w} = \frac{c_{p_w}  }{\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)+\left(\lew-1
    \right)\left[\left(h_{s,w}-h\right)-\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega
    \right)h_v\right] -\left(\omega_{s,w} - \omega \right)h_w }, \label{eq:Me1}
\end{eqnarray}

where the quantity referred to as $\Me $ in Eq. \ref{eq:Me1}, is the Merkel
number calculated according to the Poppe theory. The above described
governing equations can be solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method to
provide the evolution of the air humidity ratio, air enthalpy and Merkel
number inside the transfer area of the cooling tower (fill). Once these
profiles are known, the amount of water lost due evaporation can be
calculated as per Eq. \refeq{mwlost}. Refer to \sidecite{navarro_critical_2022}
for additional information concerning the calculation procedure.

\begin{equation} 
    Me = \frac{h_D a_v V}{\dot{m}_w}, % \label{eq:Me} %
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{m}_{w,lost}=\dot{m}_a (\omega_{a,o}-\omega_{a,i})
    \labeq{mwlost} 
\end{equation}


It is important to mention that the Merkel number varies with the operation
conditions and its value can be obtained using a correlation with the
water-to-air mass flow ratio as an independent variable. One of the proposed
correlations in ASHRAE~\sidecite[*-2]{ashrae_hvac_2004} is: $\Me =
c\left({\dot{m}_w}/{\dot{m}_a}\right)^{-n}$, where the constants $c$ and $n$
can be obtained from the fitting of experimental data\sidenote[][*-1]{See
 \nrefsec{cc:validation:poppe}}.
