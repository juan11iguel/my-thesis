    In the pursuit of extending the use and feasibility of solar thermal
    applications, a case study consisting of a commercial 50~MW-8 hours of
    storage \gls{cspLabel} plant, Andasol-II, is analyzed in annual simulations
    where the cooling solution makes use of the novel proposed \gls{ccsLabel}.
    To obtain these results, a model of the \gls{ccsLabel} has been developed
    based on the same configuration as the \gls{psaLabel} pilot plant.
    Different optimization strategies based on evolutionary algorithms have
    been implemented to adapt the system operation to the changing conditions.
    The strategy has been experimentally validated in the pilot plant and the
    simulated results show than the proposed scheme can yield ... compared to
    the \gls{dcLabel} only and ... with the \gls{wctLabel} only
    alternatives.

\section*{Structure}

This part is structured as follows: in the first two chapters the methodology is
described, specifically the modelling in (\nrefch{cc:modelling}) is presented
for the \gls{ccsLabel}, and the optimization framework in
\nrefch{cc:optimization}. The third chapter presents the experimental facility
(\nrefch{cc:facility}) that is used to experimentally validate the model and
the optimization strategy integrated in a hierarchical control scheme in
\nrefch{cc:validation}. The final chapter, \nrefch{cc:simulation}, describes
and analyzes the results of the annual simulations performed for the Andasol-II
CSP plant.
